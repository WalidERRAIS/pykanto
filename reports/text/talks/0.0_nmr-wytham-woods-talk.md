# Wytham Woods Lunchtime Talks



## 1 

Thanks Keith for organising this. Hello everyone, thanks for coming!  My name is Nilo, and I’m a 2nd year DPhil student in the zoology department, supervised by Ben Sheldon, and also by Ella Cole and Charlotte Regan

Today I’m gonna tell you about a few of the things that I have been working on in the woods. Those among you who, like me, are lucky enough to spend time doing fieldwork there might have seen me running around with a bag of recorders and wondered what on earth I was up to, so I’ll try to dispel the mystery. 

First, I will introduce my research project, and the moderate-to-little progress that I’ve made, and then I will talk about a couple of by-products of it. It’s going to be a bit of a potpourri, please be advised.

PAUSE

Let me begin by giving you a little bit of background: 

I studied anthropology as an undergrad and became really interested in cultural diversity and how cultural traits emerge and change over time, especially in domains like language and music. 

Over the years more and more people have recognised that, while non-human animals don’t have cultures as complex as ours, many do have behaviours that spread through populations and are inherited through a process of learning from other animals, which is what researchers sometimes call culture.

## 2 

These are some famous examples:

The picture on the left shows the first social behaviour that was described as a ‘social custom’ in chimpanzees, and it’s known as a grooming handclasp. 

A group of chimpanzees in the Tanzanian mountains were observed engaging in this peculiar behaviour, where two individuals clasped each other’s upraised hands while grooming each other with the other arm. 

I think it’s been more than fifteen years since this was first reported, and this population still does it, while, for example, the very well studied chimpanzees of Gombe, which is nearby, have never done it.

The one in the middle pictures a phenomenon that has been mentioned in literally every single talk on animal learning and culture that I’ve been to, to the extent that I wondered whether to include it here, but I guess it’s famous for a reason.

In the South East of England, in the 1920’s, some birds in the tit family started perforating the wax-board or metal foil that sealed milk bottles to eat the cream accumulated at the top. This behaviour increased in frequency and geographic spread in the following decades, and I guess eventually disappeared when new bottle designs made it impossible.

And finally, the one on the right shows two Capuchin monkeys, and this is a species that frequently uses large stones, sometimes almost half their own weight, to crack open palm nuts. There’s another species of Capuchin, the white-faced Capuchin of Costa Rica, which is famous for their very quirky /ˈkwəːki/ traditions, or social conventions, like hand-sniffing, eyeball-poking, and sucking of ears, fingers or tails.

## 3   

Now, another very well know example of animal culture, in this minimal definition that we’re using, is bird song.

Some bird species, mostly within the group sometimes referred to as oscines, or songbirds, sign songs that are at least in part learned from other birds. In these species, young birds reared in isolation, or with other isolates, will not come to produce the songs that are otherwise typical of their species. This has been shown in many experiments over the years, starting with landmark work done with chaffinches by Thorpe in the late 50s.

There are many hypothesis that try to explain why vocal learning has evolved in birds, and lots of debate about the function of singing more generally.

## 4

For example, William Thorpe, the Cambridge behavioural ecologist, said that “that bird song is often an expression of irrepressible joy can be supported with some plausible arguments and is certainly not without some scientific justification”.

## 5

And then we have Werner Herzog, the German film director, who, while filming Fitzcarraldo in the amazon, complained about, and these are his words, not mine, “the overwhelming misery and overwhelming fornication” of the place, saying:  “The birds are in misery. I don't think they sing. They just screech in pain”.

## 6

As you can probably tell by how serious these alternative accounts are, the evolution or function of singing is not what my research is about. I will say, though, that there’s been the occasional 15-hour fieldwork day where I tended to side with Herzog more.

Ok, back to learning, then. The fact that young birds have to learn, which different species do at different times and over periods of different length means that the songs themselves will be affected by cultural dynamics, on top of whatever else is going on due to things like for example sexual selection.

So I’m mainly interested in these cultural dynamics.

Some of the questions that my research deals with have to do with patterns of cultural transmission, or learning, and how factors like space and demography influence both the process and its outcomes.

## 7

In particular, I am studying the songs of the great tit population in Wytham Woods, and I hope that studying a population like this can help us understand how cultural traits change with time and over distance in a wild animal population.

Many people have studied the songs of great tits before, and this includes some amazing work done in this same population over the years. So I am definitely not inventing anything new here, of course. Instead, what I am trying to do is really to use some new tools to study more birds at once, and, at the same time, have more detailed information for each individual bird.

Great tits sing simple songs, but there is a lot of variation from bird to bird. Usually the males are the ones that sing, and they do it more often early in the mornings while the female is fertile, as you’ll see later. The songs are thought to be used both to defend their territories and to attract mates. They seem to learn songs mostly from birds that they encounter before they breed for the first time, and their song repertoire changes very little after their first year, or it doesn’t at all.

## 8

I’m going to play a couple of examples, I hope you can hear them OK. You can see the sound represented as an image as well, this is called an spectrogram. I’m going to play a few songs, which I’m sure you’ll recognise. 

==spectrograms== **PLAY SONG**, explain note and syllable

So to sum up, my project has to do with questions like how what we could call song cultural diversity emerges at the population level, how demographic and social factors might influence the learning of songs (and the songs themselves), and how the songs change over time and space. 

I’ve spent most of the first half of the project dealing with the logistics of recording and cataloguing the songs of so many birds, and I’m going to tell you briefly about the process.

## 9

Now, the nest boxes that the birds use are checked weekly at the start of the breeding season by a team fieldworkers. I wrote a little program that tells me when a new box is marked as having great tit activity, and it also adds its location to a map on my phone. I then go find it—which can be easier said than done—and place a recorder in a tree close to it. 

Last year I used 30 small autonomous recorders, AudioMoths they’re called, which I put inside waterproof cases that I made. You can see one in the picture in the middle here. 

There are always many more birds than recorders, so I move each recorder to a different nest every three days. Last year all the birds were very synchronised in their egg-laying, so things escalated very quickly! 

## 10

Last year, as things became a bit quieter on the recording front, I also started doing a nest round,,,,,, and this involves visiting every nestbox in an area of the woods and recording a bunch of information, as well as catching and ringing the parents and later the chicks. Here’s what that looks like, look how cute and unimpressed great tit chicks look.

## 11

OK, so here’s a map of what I recorded last spring. 

Each point is a nest where there were great tits at some point. The bigger the white point, the more songs recorded there. 

Orange points are for nests I didn’t make it to, and blue for those where I didn’t get any songs.

STOP

In total I recorded almost 7 thousand hours of audio, which would take almost a whole year to listen to in real time. I got enough songs to allow analysis in over half of the nestboxes I recorded at.

## 12

This plot shows how singing activity, measured as number of songs recorded in a five-minute interval, changes throughout the breeding season. STOP

You can see how there is more singing at dawn, which we know takes place before the female emerges from the nestbox———and you can also see how the peak in singing activity coincides with the peak of egg laying. 

LET PLAY

In addition, you can see how singing activity tends to happen earlier in the day in later dates, tracking the advancing sunrise times, although there is noise introduced by weather conditions here.

Because this peak in singing activity is so sharp, last year really I struggled to keep up with it, because I couldn't physically move that many recorders around. This led to a pretty substantial bottleneck, which you can see…

## 13

 …here.

The white curvy line represents the average time that passed from the onset of egg laying to when I recorded a bird at that nest, which I’m going to call lag. The histogram shows the count of nests that had new eggs in any given day, and you can clearly see how the lag increases when nests accumulate. 

The result of all this is that I record fewer songs, if you look at the right panel you can see how that kind of lag is outside the optimal range where more songs are recorded.

This year we’re going to have more recorders and hands, so I think we are in good shape.

But anyway, once I have all these thousands of hours of recordings, I need to find and catalogue individual notes, which are the smallest unit of analysis. 

## 14

The recordings can be quite noisy, so I developed an algorithm to segment songs into notes that deals with this. 

Here you can see how a regular segmentation process has trouble distinguishing noise from notes. 

## 15

So, first, the algorithm de-echoes, or dereberverates, the sound, you can see how this already improves the result, but the first note in the song is still getting away.

## 16

Then it cleans the spectrogram further, you can see how every note is detected now, and it saves note onsets and offset times to the database.

COUNT TO 2

## 17

Here you can see a few notes as an example of the end product, this what a single bird sang in a single morning.

Each syllable is represented as a 64 by 64-pixel image

COUNT TO 4

## 18

So here what I’ve done is I’ve projected all the notes in just two dimensions so that we can visualise it, using two different methods.

At this level, and we’re looking at every note for every bird, there is a lot of continuity, and there are no distinct groups of similar notes. 

This is expected, because notes are quite simple and there are just not that many degrees of freedom available to the birds, so a relatively small population like this already explores the note feature space quite thoroughly.

## 19

For individual birds, though, it’s a very different story: they sing categorically distinct notes and these are clearly distinguishable. 

These are a few examples that contain the entire repertoires of a few birds, where each point is one note and colours represent clusters of notes.

In case you’re curious, the male that sung the notes in the large plot on the right here was born in 2018, one kilometre to the south of where I recorded it. 

The female was born 800 metres to the north east, also in 2018. They raised 9 chicks, and If I remember right they all fledged

PAUSE

The fact that individual notes cluster cleanly is something that we can exploit to infer the size and composition of a bird’s repertoire, and to do it automatically as well. I say automatically and it sounds good, but I have a feeling that, in the time it took me to write and debug the algorithm that does it,  I could have done it manually!

## 20 

I’m not going to go into much detail here, but in short the process has two main parts: labelling  notes and inferring song types from sequences of notes.

First, I assign notes to note types based on similarity and how they are connected in a sequence. In this example here, which is a very clean one, the method finds six different note types for this particular bird.

COUNT TO 7

## 21

The next step, then, is to infer song types from the raw sequence data, which is a bit tricky because sometimes there is noise, and there are ambiguous sequences and palindromes. In the end what we have is a dataset which has notes classified into distinct song types for each bird, and also the transition probabilities between them, as you can see in the graph ‘C’ on the right

## 22

These are just a couple of summary plots for the entire dataset. 

In **A** we can see that the average bird sings around 6 or 8 different notes, arranged in about half that number of song types. This matches other estimates done here and in other populations. Which is a relief!

We can see in **B** that most birds sung a relatively small number of notes, and then there is a long tail, with one bird singing over 10 thousand notes in just three days!

An then finally **C** shows that most notes are around a tenth of a second long.

There’s plenty to talk about when it comes to the composition and characteristics of songs and their variability, and I’m also in the middle of preparing the data to test those ideas that I was telling you about about cultural change, but I don’t want to run out of time, so for now I think I’m just gonna give you an example that has to do with the rhythmic and melodic structure of the songs and then show you a couple of other things.

## 23

There’s this very well known phenomenon where human music is often organised in rhythmic patterns that have small integer ratios, rhythms that are perceived and produced at fractions of small numbers, so like three over two or five over four. Even when given random drum patterns to copy, people in very different cultures subconsciously transform them toward small integer ratios.

And it’s quite interesting, because the same is true for the relationship between the frequencies of the notes, so that musical scales are often based on small integer ratios. 

Some people have suggested in the past that this could be culturally specific to western music, but recent cross-cultural work has shown that it might actually be a statistical universal. 

One leading idea to explain this is that simple integer ratios maximise the overlap between harmonic frequency spectra and sound more consonant, so there could be a universal bioacoustic principle behind it.

Indeed, some people think that these rhythmic and melodic patterns might be important in other species, that they might contribute to how some animals produce acoustic signals. Very few species have been shown to use simple ratios, as far as I’m aware, but I guess absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

So, anyway, I have taken a cursory look at what’s going on with the rhythms and frequencies of Wytham tits:

## 24

I measured the time from the start of one note in a song to the next, and that’s what’s called the Inter-Onset Interval, which is how rhythm is usually characterised, ——— and I also measured the dominant frequency of each note in the dataset. 

So the plot on the left, the one that says frequency intervals, shows the relationship between the frequencies of the first and second notes in every song type in the dataset.

And the one on the right shows the relationship between the first and second Inter-Onset Intervals.

The continuous diagonal line represents a one to one ratio, and colours correspond to probability density: more likely regions are hotter.

Both rhythm and frequency are centred close to small integer ratios, and I was surprised to see that, in both cases, 4 over 5 in particular seems to be a bit of an attractor. 

That is, the mathematical relationship between both frequencies and times tends to follow the same pattern, where the first note tends to be 0 point 8 times the frequency of the second, and the first interval is 0 point 8 times the duration of the second.

This is more a curiosity than anything else, I think, but it does fit in with this idea that preference for small integer ratios might be of relevance in other species. It could be that this arises due to sensory biases, or it could be that frequencies and rhythms related by small integer ratios are easier to memorise, and this does seem to be the case for humans. 

## 25

I’m going to shift gears now and show you a couple of other things, I did say it would be a bit of a potpourri didn’t I?

Although the great tits were of course my main target, recording at so many locations in the woods means that I have accidentally collected, and will continue to collect, a very large dataset - remember, it’s like 7 thousand hours already. It feels a bit like throwing a trawl net, but without all the negative consequences, of course. This means that I have loads of data for other species, and also a lot of information that can be mined about how the woods sound in different places and at different times.

## 26

To give you a more visual feel for what this means, I’ve taken recordings from different parts of the woods, from 4 to 5 in the morning, and I’ve put together a dataset with 5-minute sound averages. What you are seeing is a projection of all of those fragments into three spatial dimensions. I’ve used an algorithm for dimensionality reduction that was developed mainly to study cell differentiation and development, and which is very good for visualising trajectories and the like.

I’ve highlighted two areas of the woods, Bean and Marley P, Bean in red and Marley P in blue, and you can see how there is overlap in what they sound like, but also regions that are not shared, trajectories that are unique to them. We could do the same with the rest, this is just a random example. Something similar happens if you do the same but with a more longitudinal sample, you can actually see how sound changes through the morning, for example, or find rare sounds that are very different from anything else.

## 27

And here’s another example: the somewhat spooky Tawny Owl calls.  Each light in this christmassy map is a location from which I recorded Tawny Owl calls, the brighter ones are those where the sound was louder. This is what this landscape sounds like:

PLAY TAWNY CALLS

## 28: Change to the last slide!

I hope you have found it interesting,

I’ll be happy to try to answer any questions that you might have.
