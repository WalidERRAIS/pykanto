## General introduction

### Animal culture and social learning

Culture was once considered the sole domain of humans. Over the past few decades this view has been steadily challenged, and today it is common to find allusions to non-human animal cultures in scientific journals and the popular press alike [@Whiten2019a]. To be sure, some energetically oppose the notion, and there is no shortage of disagreement over the definition of the term ‘culture’ [@Laland2003; @Heyes2020a]. Intricate and distinctive as human culture might be, an increasing number of students of behaviour and evolution suspect that the difference must be one of degree and not kind [@Whiten2017].

What constitutes culture, then? For our purposes, we can define it as any behavioural trait that is maintained in a population by virtue of being learnt from others; not genetically inherited, nor independently acquired. [See definitions in @Whiten2017; @Laland2003.] Human ritual funerary practices are cultural, so is the game of croquet. And, under this definition, so are tool use in capuchin monkeys, homing efficiency in pigeons, the songs of many birds, some feeding behaviours in humpback whales, and even mate preferences in fruit flies [@Falotico2019; @Sasaki2017a; @Slater2003; @Allen2013a; @Danchin2018].

Social learning is ubiquitous among animals, and a prerequisite for culture. Although it may not always be beneficial [@Giraldeau2002; @Whitehead2009; @Henrich1998], there is ample evidence that many of the things that animals must learn to survive and reproduce can only be acquired by observing or interacting with others [@Galef2005]. Learning will happen more often from animals that are closer in space or within the same social group. This simple fact creates opportunities for behaviours to change differently in different populations, which may happen if, for example, individuals vary in their learning abilities, the environment is heterogeneous, or there are random forces at play [@Aplin2016; @Mesoudi2016; @Araya-Salas2019]. When these differences—beneficial or not—accumulate and persist over time, a cultural tradition is born [@Nunn2009; @Tchernichovski2017a].

Whether found in humans or other animals, cultures can be transient or long-lasting, disorderly diverse or monolithically uniform. To give two primate examples, chimpanzees (*Pan troglodytes*) may have used stone tools in a similar way for thousands of years [@Mercader2007; @Carvalho2008], and white-faced capuchin monkeys (*Cebus capucinus*) frequently invent and abandon quirky social conventions such as eyeball-poking, hand-sniffing and tail-sucking [@Perry2003]. 

### Culture in birds

That other animals have a cultural dimension was recognised very early in birds, perhaps before any other group. In 1773, Barrington, who conducted some of the earliest experiments in song learning, wrote that “[t]hese differences in the song of birds of the same species cannot perhaps be compared to any thing more apposite, than the varieties of provincial dialects” [-@Barrington1773, p. 280]. In 1920’s South East England, some birds in the tit family started perforating the wax-board or metal foil that sealed milk bottles to guzzle the cream accumulated at the top. This behaviour increased in frequency and geographic spread in the following decades [@Fisher1949], in what became a famous case of possible cultural transmission. Many years later, @Aplin2015 carried out experiments in a wild population of great tits (*Parus major*) which demonstrated that new foraging behaviours can indeed spread socially and persist over more than one generation.

Another aspect of the lives of some birds that could have an important cultural component is their migration. There is mounting evidence that the information acquired by individuals and groups when flying along a route can accumulate in populations and, over time and even generations, lead to distinct migratory cultures [@Sasaki2017a; @Berdahl2018; @Jesmer2018]. There are many other examples of social learning and cultural phenomena in birds, see @Aplin2018 for a recent review.

But it is their song, especially that of passerines, that has provided some of the clearest examples of bird cultures. Songs can carry information about the identity and social position of a bird; they are shaped by natural and sexual selection, stochastic processes and directional cultural change, are partly learnt and partly innate, and can crucially be recorded and analysed in minute detail. So it is perhaps not surprising that they should have attracted the attention of researchers from a wide range of fields, from linguistics to evolutionary ecology. The resulting body of literature is vast and cannot be reviewed here: what follows is a short introduction to bird song.

## Bird song: a short introduction

### Historical

Every culture that has ever existed has probably conferred special status to bird song, due to its music-like qualities and the ability of some species to imitate myriad sounds. In his *Historia Animalium* (350 B.C.E), Aristotle wrote that birds were capable of learning their songs, especially ‘broad-tongued’ ones, and that sometimes their voice changed with the ‘diversity of locality’ ([Book 4, Chapter 9](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.4.iv.html)) like those of humans. Aristotle’s is perhaps the earliest recorded attempt at a systematic study of communication, and the first in a long tradition of analogies drawn between bird song and human language [@Kleczkowska2015; @Zirin1980]. 

Many centuries later, in 1650, the German Jesuit Athanasius Kircher used musical notation to transcribe bird songs in an early musicology treatise, *Musurgia Universalis*. [The first known recording](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b00jn4m2) of a singing bird was made in 1889 by Ludwig Koch—the pioneering sound recordist and broadcaster—when he was only eight years old. Then, in the 1940s, the invention of the sound spectrograph at the Bell Telephone Laboratories paved the way for a new generation of studies that were, for the first time, able to measure songs in all manner of detail [@Koenig1946; @Baker2001]. The best example of these is an exhaustive study of the development of the song in the chaffinch *Fringilla coelebs* by @Thorpe1958, which was followed by an explosion of interest in the matter—both in the field [@Marler1962; @Marler1964] and the laboratory [see, for example, @Nottebohm1976 on the neurobiology of song production]—that continues unabated to this day.

### Why do some birds learn their songs?{#why-learn}

Most birds vocalise, but vocal learning only occurs in three orders (Psittaciformes, Apodiformes, and Passeriformes; [@Kroodsma2004; @Packert2018a]). Within the passerines, commonly referred to as the perching birds, oscines learn their songs, while suboscines do not. Song learning requires a considerable investment of time and a dedicated brain system, so why might it have evolved and be maintained? 

There are many hypotheses that try to explain the possible benefits of vocal learning. These include a better ability to match the acoustic requirements of different habitats[@Hansen1979; @Rios-Chelen2012], possible benefits gained from sharing songs with neighbours [@Payne2015], and the ability of learned songs to serve as an ‘honest signal’ of developmental stability [@Nowicki2002; @Ritchie2008]. Most of the available evidence points to two broad functions: attracting and keeping mates and keeping rivals away [@Collins2004]. However, there is ample variation between species, and the current fitness consequences of song learning, on which these ideas are based, do not necessarily bear on its evolutionary origins. 

Not all birds that learn their songs do so at the same point in their lives or for the same period of time. Some can only learn during the first months after they are born: zebra finch (*Taeniopygia guttata*) juveniles, for example, can only learn and develop their song when they are between ~ 20 and 80 days old [@Liu2004]. Other birds can continue to learn and perhaps invent new sounds throughout their lives, like the European starling (*Sturnus vulgaris*). And many birds that disperse early in their lives have a ‘sensitive period’ for learning that extends to the time when they establish their first territory [@Liu2004; @Beecher2005]. Although this range of variation is often summarised into two categories—open and closed-ended learners—it may be better understood as a spectrum [@Brenowitz2005]. Lastly, there is extraordinary variability in repertoire size and complexity among vocal learners. Some birds learn and sing a single song, which they repeat endlessly. Other species, like the brown thrasher (*Toxostoma rufum*), never seem to stop incorporating new sounds to their songs [@Boughey1981].

### (Some of) The forces that shape bird song

In this section I will discuss physiological constraints on song production and phylogenetic inertia, ecological factors, and sexual selection. These are crucial in diving large-scale patterns of song evolution, but not the focus of my research. I will then introduce some ideas about cultural transmission dynamics, innate learning biases, and spatial, social and demographic factors. They affect the change in frequency of socially learnt songs and their properties, that is, their cultural evolution [@Whiten2019]. It is these that I will explore throughout my thesis. All of these processes and their often complex interactions influence bird song and its evolution, but their relative weight is debated. 

#### Physiological constraints and phylogenetic inertia

Birds produce their songs using an organ called the syrinx, which is located at the base of the trachea in an air sac close to the lungs [@Larsen2002]. Its structure and precise location vary between species; those with more complex songs tend to have more syringeal muscles, which allows for precise control of sound [@Suthers2004]. The sounds produced by the syrinx are then filtered and modulated by the trachea and the beak, which together constitute the vocal tract [@Podos2004]. The body mass of a species is correlated with the size of its syrinx, which in turn influences the fundamental or lowest resonant frequency of the sounds that it can produce [@Ryan1985; @Martin2011]. 

This means that vocal evolution will be constrained by any selective pressures impinging on body size, as well as the particular evolutionary trajectory of the species. The same is true in the case of the beak: there is ample evidence that different beak morphologies influence the pace at which a bird can produce notes and the range of their frequencies [@Derryberry2018b; @Derryberry2012; @Seddon2005; @Podos2001]. These and other constraints, not least those derived from neural development and energy expenditure, will determine the degrees of freedom afforded to any other factors driving song evolution.

#### Ecological factors

Sound propagates differently in different habitats. For example, vegetation attenuates sound amplitude, filters some frequencies more than others, and causes reverberation. Different physical environments have different levels of background noise, with varied acoustic characteristics; there may be sounds of abiotic origin, such as wind, streams and rain, and a cacophony of other species striving to be heard. For songs to be effective they need to be detectable, and this process of acoustic adaptation is thought to be important in driving the evolution of song and other social signals [@Endler1992; @Tobias2010; @Grant2010; but see @Mikula2020 and @Irwin2008a]. 

There are other ecological factors that can lead to song divergence. Body size and beak morphology often change when a population of birds adapts to a different foraging niche, which, as mentioned earlier, can influence some of the acoustic and temporal features of songs as a by-product. [@Dobzhansky1937; @Mayr1963; @Podos2001]. Songs can also change if coexistence between species (sympatry) favours those that can distinguish them more easily, which can help avoid the fitness costs of hybridization or aggresive interactions; this is a mechanism known as character displacement [@Seddon2005]. Interestingly, the opposite—convergent character displacement in sympatry—might also happen if better recognition of competitors is advantageous [@Tobias2009; @Tobias2014; @Grant1972].

#### Sexual selection

Bird song has traditionally been considered a male ornament that evolved through female preference. It is true that in the northern temperate region—where most research has historically taken place—females do not often sing. But recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that, at least in the oscine passerines, dimorphism in the trait is a consequence of multiple losses of elaborate female song rather than gains in males [@Odom2014]. 

Most of the work done in the field of behavioural ecology over the past decades has focused on how females respond to songs and how males use them in territorial interactions. As a result, there is a vast literature detailing how songs can encode multiple messages and serve different, sexually selected functions, with great variation between species and sometimes inconsistent results [see @Catchpole2003 and @Gil2002 for reviews]. To name just a few themes: song frequency can be a reliable indicator of body size [@Ryan1985], temporal and spectral consistency can evidence the nutritional stress suffered in early life [@MacDonald2006], and sharing songs with other males can influence territory acquisition and the outcome of agonistic encounters [@Krebs1978; @Demko2016a]. Bird song is a highly complex communication signal, so it should be no surprise that it does not have a single, universal function.

#### Learning biases and cultural dynamics {#intro-learning-biases}

The process of learning introduces a host of new variables that can influence which songs a bird sings, their structure, and how they change over time. First, songs have to be learnt from someone. A bird may learn them from any other bird or, instead, some ‘tutors’ may be preferred: perhaps birds that are older, louder, or sing more often[@Greig2012]. This is variously referred to as a tutor, model or demonstrator bias in the cultural evolution literature [ref]. If the cultural transmission of a song happens from parents to offspring it is said to be vertical; horizontal if it happens from other birds in the same generation, and oblique from unrelated individuals in the previous generation [ref]. Sometimes, tutor choice can have extreme consequences: if a female pairs up with a male of a different species because he sings the same song as her father, and her father learnt the ‘wrong’ song, this can lead to the production of hybrid offspring [@Grant1997; Grant1997a].

Some songs might be preferred independently of who sings them—a ‘content bias’ [@Richerson2005]. For example, some song types might be intrinsically harder to sing than others, and male birds could favour learning either easy-to-sing songs or the opposite if singing difficult songs is rewarded. More broadly, there is a very well documented tendency for birds to learn the songs sung by members of their own species [@Slabbekoorn2002], or even subspecies [@Nelson2000]. Preferences can arise through the interaction of innate biases for some regions of the syntactic or phonetic ’trait space’, exposure to sounds during early life and the learning process itself [@Feher2017; @Verzijden2012; @Feher2009]. Importantly, this interaction can be highly complex and show great variation between individuals [see @TenCate2007; @Mets2019; @Mets2017; @James2020].

Birds can also learn a song based on how frequently they have heard it, or how many other birds sing a particular variant [@VanLeeuwen2015; @Aplin2015a]. The relationship between the frequency of a trait in a population and the probability that it is learnt can be linear: if this is the case, transmission is unbiased. However, if more popular traits are more likely to be learnt than it would expected given their frequency, learning is said to be conformist, or positively frequency-dependent. And if the opposite is true the pattern is one of anti-conformism, or negative frequency-dependence. Conformist learning seems to be a common strategy in nature, perhaps because it can help individuals to leverage collective information to make decisions about locally adaptive behaviour [@Pike2010; @Danchin2018; @Whiten2019]. All else being equal, cultural traits will have a slower rate of change if their learning is conformist. Conversely, anti-conformist biases will cause faster turnover [@Acerbi2014], and might arise if individuals have a preference for novelty [but see @Smaldino2015].

Another determinant of the pace of change of a population’s songs is how accurately birds learn them. Some authors have tried to calculate ‘cultural mutation rates’ for different species to reflect how much songs change from one generation to the next: chaffinches, for example, appear to learn their songs very accurately [@Lachlan2003; @Slater1986], which slows change down. But determining this quantity is complicated by the fact that many other factors also influence the tempo of cultural change. One is the learning strategy used by individuals, already mentioned. Another is the fact that songs can be modified during the learning process in non-random directions, in a process sometimes called convergent transformation or cultural attraction [@Claidiere2018b; @Gray2007a; @Morin2016; @Heyes1993]. This can be illustrated by an elegant experiment carried out by @Feher2009: song tutoring lineages were started with birds that were raised in isolation, and each new bird learned from the previous—mimicking natural generations of tutors and pupils. Many of the song features that are typical in the species arose over the course of just a few generations, presumably as a consequence of directional modifications introduced by the learners. 

The available evidence suggests that the changes brought about by cultural dynamics are often neutral or even negative [ref], akin to random genetic drift [@Grant2010].  However, in some cases, cultural change might help birds adapt to novel acoustic landscapes [@Rios-Chelen2012; @Slater2013], or fine-tune the song’s characteristics to better match the shifting perceptual preferences of the receivers [@Renoult2019a]. At larger timescales, the accumulation of either neutral or directional cultural changes in songs might promote reproductive isolation between populations. Nevertheless, and although this possibility has attracted much interest, the evidence for it is lacking [@Verzijden2012; @Yeh2015; @Lachlan2004]. Finally, it is important to note that songs are not necessarily fixed sets of notes or phrases, and different elements might change at different rates and be affected by different cultural, sexual or ecological pressures [see, for example, @Williams2013a and @VanBoheemen2019b]. 

#### Spatial, social and demographic factors{#intro-spatial-demographic}

The most fundamental determinant of the interactions that lead to vocal learning in a population is the habitat that it occupies. Its physical features, vegetation structure and distribution of resources—which are all tightly linked—bound the use of space made by individuals. This in turn influences their social interactions and emergent social organisation [ see @He2019 for a review] and, ultimately, who learns from whom.

Spatial proximity will typically be correlated with vocal similarity if the birds in a population learn their songs with some accuracy and their dispersal is limited. The precise nature of this pattern will depend on whether birds disperse before or after they learn, how many songs they learn, and from how many birds [@Williams1990; @Ellers2003], as well as the many sources of learning bias discussed above. When birds remain close to the location where they learned, or if they settle in places where they hear familiar songs, dialects or local song ‘neighbourhoods’ may emerge [@Podos2007]. It then follows that increased dispersal between any two areas within a population will increase vocal sharing, and that the influx of immigrants from other populations will introduce new variation—a phenomenon that has been attested in wild populations [@Fayet2014]. 

The size of a group and its rate of turnover are also important. First, smaller groups are expected to be more influenced by stochastic factors, paralleling the effects of genetic drift on small populations [@Kimura1964]. As a consequence, smaller group sizes can increase the probability of extinction of any given song variant [@Nunn2009], and lead to idiosyncratic changes in song structure [@Lachlan2013]. Second, higher background mortality and emigration will also lead to faster rates of change, independently of the learning strategy employed by individuals or the fidelity of their learning [@Nunn2009; @Slater1986].

A few theoretical and experimental results suggest that the number, distribution and connectedness of individuals in a population could influence the complexity of cultural traits in addition to its frequency distribution [see, for example, @Derex2018a; @Derex2016a; @Creanza2017, @Fogarty2017; @Kempe2014a]. Bird song is strongly constrained by ecological and cognitive factors, as well as sexual selection, so there is little reason to think that this phenomenon—which might be of great importance in human culture—could alone lead to appreciable gains in its complexity. There is, however, some evidence from laboratory experiments that suggests that the availability of tutors and the quality of their instruction can reduce the influence of genetically inherited biases [@Mets2019; @Mets2017]. This mechanism could help to explain the losses of song cultural diversity observed in some fragmented populations [@Paxton2019; @Hart2018a]: lower densities and fewer individuals might reduce opportunities for learning, which would increase the influence of strong genetic contributions to the song phenotype.

\end{center}

As we have seen, learning biases and strategies, space use, sociality and demography are all thought to contribute to shaping temporal and spatial patterns of bird song diversity. But their relative importance is not well known, and neither is how they interact in wild populations. A long and fruitful history of field studies has provided us with many examples of some of these processes; however, these works have typically been limited by a) small sample sizes, b) a lack of data for individual birds, c) the use of handpicked acoustic features to characterise songs, and d) the aprioristic assumption that population-wide ‘song types’ exist. Learning biases and the process of cultural transmission of bird song have been studied in the laboratory with great precision, but it is difficult to judge how well they represent natural conditions.

This thesis will provide a comprehensive exploration of these factors—as well as their interaction—in a wild great tit (*Parus major*) population that has been the subject of a long-term study (see [study system](#study-system)). Great tits have become a model species for evolutionary, ecological and cognitive studies in natural populations [@Boyce1987; @Charmantier2008; @Spurgin2019; @Firth2018a; @Firth2018; @Cole2012; @Aplin2017]. Their life-history and behaviour are very well known, which, together with the characteristics of their song, makes them an ideal species to study. Male great tits sing a repertoire of one to eight simple song variants [@Krebs1978; @Rivera-Gutierrez2010a], each consisting of a small number of notes that are repeated in a stereotypical manner. They learn these songs primarily from conspecifics and during their first year of life, until they have established a territory [@McGregor1982; @McGregor1989], and as a consequence are more likely to share them with neighbouring males than with other birds [@McGregor1982]. In addition, there is some evidence that the similarity of their songs and the relative novelty and size of neighbourhood repertoires are influenced by spatial and demographic factors [@Fayet2014; @Rivera-Gutierrez2010a].

# Methods{#methods}

## Study system{#study-system}

The study was carried out in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK (51°46′N, 1°20′W). Wytham woods is a semi-natural deciduous woodland, around 415 hectares in extension, which is surrounded by farmland. Here, a population of great tits is monitored as part of a long-term survey that began in 1947. The majority of great tits nests in nestboxes with known locations. Every year, fieldworkers record the identities of breeding males and females, the dates of clutch initiation and egg hatching, clutch size, and fledgling success under standardised protocols. A large proportion of birds in the population are fitted with a unique British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) metal leg ring either as nestlings or as adults. During the breeding season, from March to June, great tit pairs are socially monogamous and defend territories around their nestboxes [@Hinde1952].

## Song recording

Every nestbox in the study site is checked by fieldworkers at least once a week before and during egg-laying, which can last from one to 14 days [@Perrins1965]. When a nestbox was marked as having great tit activity, which usually coincided with the laying of the first eggs, I placed an autonomous sound recorder in the vicinity of the nestbox—either in the same tree or in a suitable neighbouring tree. I recorded birds in this manner from early April until mid-May, leaving each recorder in the same location for three consecutive days before moving it to a different nestbox. I relocated ten recorders every day throughout the duration of the recording period.

I used 30 AudioMoth recorders  [@Hill2019b], which were housed in waterproof, custom-built enclosures (See Fig X). Recording began approximately one hour before sunrise (~ 05:36 – 04:00 UTC) and consisted of seven 59-minute-long (one hour minus one-minute pauses) recordings with a sample rate of 48 kHz.

\end{figure}

## Definitions

There is not a consistent set of terms used to refer to the different levels at which the acoustic output of a bird can be described. For clarity, these are the definitions that I use throughout this work:

| Term          | Definition                                                   |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Note**      | A single uninterrupted vocalisation; the smallest unit of analysis |
| **Phrase**    | The smallest set of different notes that are repeated stereotypically |
| **Song**      | One or more repeated phrases preceded and followed by silences of a duration exceeding that of the longest silence between each note in a phrase |
| **Song bout** | A set of one or more songs that are preceded and followed by silences longer than 10 seconds. I will change this to a probabilistic definition based on the distribution of silence durations; typically a more or less arbitrary threshold is used but I’d rather have a better-grounded definition |

\end{figure}

### Pre-processing and segmentation

#### Song segmentation

I inspected spectrograms for each raw recording aided by AviaNZ, an open-source Python program written by Marsland and colleagues [@Marsland2019].  I selected songs based on a simple criterion: that its notes were clearly distinct from background noise and other bird vocalisations. I chose entire songs where it was possible; where it was not, I selected the longest contiguous segment available.

I included songs produced from approximately one hour before sunrise to four hours after sunrise for each bird and day. If a 59-min recording solely contained rain or wind sounds I also included the following 59-min recording to maximise the chances of recording a bird.

#### Assigning song bouts to individuals

As a consequence of the automated nature of the recording process, there is a small chance that some of the songs recorded in the immediate vicinity of a given nest box do not belong to the focal bird. To minimise the chance of false positives, I discarded recordings with more than one vocalising bird if one was not distinctly louder than the rest. I also discarded all songs with a maximum amplitude below $-16$ dB, calculated as $20\log_{10}(\frac{A}{A_0})$, with $A= 5000$ and $A_0=32767$ (the maximum value for 16-bit digital audio). This threshold derives from the observation that, in those cases where there are simultaneous recordings of several immediate neighbours, an amplitude cutoff greater than 4000 always separates a focal bird from its nearest neighbours. Note that these are not calibrated values and are, therefore, relative to the recording equipment and settings I used—as well as other factors like sound directionality and vegetation cover.

#### Note segmentation

I segmented the resulting song selections into their constituent notes using a dynamic threshold algorithm implemented by @Sainburg2019b. Briefly, the algorithm finds minima in the spectral envelope of a spectrogram, which are considered silences; if the length of the signal between these minima exceeds a maximum note duration, a new local minimum is defined that divides the signal in two shorter segments. This is repeated until multiple notes are defined or there are no local minima below a maximum amplitude threshold. Then, segments below a minimum note duration threshold are discarded. The minimum and maximum note length thresholds were determined by segmenting a small subset of songs (n = 30) with Chipper, an open-source, Python-based software developed by @Searfoss2020. \autoref{fig:sample-segmentation} shows an example of this segmentation in a simple case.

**Note**: I am currently working on implementing a segmentation algorithm that deals better with reverberation. Sometimes the previous note overlaps with the next and the current algorithm fails to separate them.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth, center]{figures/sample_segmentation.png}
  \caption[An illustration of the note segmentation process]{An illustration of the note segmentation process.}
  \label{fig:sample-segmentation}
\end{figure}

#### Spectrograms

I created spectrograms for each individual note in the dataset from its normalised and band-passed waveform. I then log-scaled each spectrogram and clipped all values within the fifth lowest percentile, to remove background noise of low amplitude. I then zero-padded each spectrogram with length below the longest note and built a dataset containing the metadata for each note and its spectrogram.

### Dimensionality reduction and clustering

#### At the population level

I prepared a $N × d$-dimensional array, with $N =$ total number of notes in the dataset and $d = 64 × 132$, or the length of a flattened two-dimensional spectrogram array. I then projected the first array onto a low-dimensional embedding found using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, [@McInnes2018]) and PHATE  (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding, [@Moon2019]), two non-linear manifold learning and dimensionality reduction algorithms. Full details of the implementation and parameters can be found in the corresponding [code module](#code-availability); see \autoref{fig:umap} for an example of a projection into two dimensions.

  \label{fig:umap}
\end{figure}

#### For individual birds

In a similar way, I used UMAP to project every note sung by each bird onto a lower-dimensional space. Specifically, I created a two-dimensional projection for visualisation and a ten-dimensional projection for clustering. I then used the latter to infer the note types sung by each bird, by finding areas occupied more densely within the acoustic space using HDBSCAN [@McInnes2017, see \autoref{fig:transitions}]. 

**Note:** I am currently defining ‘hard’ clusters, where notes are labelled as either clusters or noise. This makes some clusters a little bit noisy. I might try to implement ‘fuzzy’ clustering, where cluster membership is defined by probability vectors, and deal more strictly with outliers. Density-based clustering from the UMAP embedding works well, but I will also define clusters using a linear embedding.

### Inferring note transitions

I defined a directed weighted graph $G = (V, E, w)$ describing the repertoire of each bird, where the vertices $V$ are the set of note clusters with $> 10$ members and the directed edges $E$  and weight $w$ correspond to first-order Markov transition probabilities between them. When a set of $n$ notes consistently appeared in the same order I considered them a song type (see \autoref{fig:transitions}).

### Models of sampling success

I modelled the number of recorded songs in a zero-inflated negative binomial generalized additive model, with the lag from the onset of egg-laying to the date of recording, the april lay date, and their interaction as population-level effects. Models fit with the brms package [@Burkner2017a] and compared using leave-one-out cross validation [@Vehtari2017a].

### Measuring acoustic distance

I am currently extending a method devised by @Mets2018 to measure learning accuracy in the lab to work with unknown tutors and in a larger acoustic space. Once this is ready I will build distance matrices at the note, phrase and song transition levels, and these will be the basis of all subsequent analyses.

## Quantifying the 2020 dataset

###  Sampling

  \caption[Map of sampling locations and number of songs recorded]{Map of sampling locations and number of songs recorded in 2020.}
  \label{fig:map}
\end{figure}

I recorded a total of 6811 hours of sound over the course of 37 days, from April 9 to May 15, in 240 nestboxes that were occupied by great tits. I detected at least one song in 201 of them (range 1-1972) which, after segmenting and filtering, resulted in a complete dataset of 18.847 songs, with a total of 182.616 individual notes. Of these 201 birds, 161 had enough notes to allow more detailed analyses. Finally, of the latter, 90 have known identities. In total, I recorded at 91.6% of the nestboxes that were marked as having a great tit nest during the entire breeding season (240 out of 262), and sampling was not spatially biased. You can find an interactive map of the spatial coverage, density and distribution of number of songs [here](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/nilomr/ckfhy64eh0afo19nvaz6t4mfq.html?fresh=true&title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoibmlsb21yIiwiYSI6ImNqcTBzajZ0ejBudTE0Mm80aGxncWFrZjQifQ.feJoZY-fjYRBncHSMGWCwA); see also \autoref{fig:map}.

### Songs and notes

The distribution of note counts follows a power law: birds for which there is a large number of notes are much rarer than birds with only a few notes (see \autoref[.B]{fig:frequencies}:B). The mean number of note types per bird is 7, and they range from 2 to 16. If we take into account that most song types consist of two different notes this closely matches estimates by @McGregor1981a, who found that the population mean was close to 3 song types, and individuals sung from 1 to 8 song types [compare \autoref[.A]{fig:frequencies} and Fig. 6 in @McGregor1982].

\autoref{fig:time-of-day} shows how singing activity changed throughout the morning, with most songs recorded between 4 and 5 UTC, and \autoref{fig:durations} shows the distribution of note duration for all males in the dataset. Finally, \autoref{fig:cumulative} plots the cumulative number of song types against the number of songs recorded. Although it is likely that the dataset underrepresents the number of song types sung by some males, most curves reach an asymptote.

### Sampling success

Longer lags between the date in which the first egg was laid in a given nest and the date in which I recorded the corresponding male were strongly associated with a decrease in the number of songs recorded (mean incidence rate ratio, IRR = 0.91, 95% CI [0.87- 0.95]. This lag did not interact with the april lay date (IRR = 1.0, 95% CI [0.99-1.01]), which was independently but more weakly associated with a decrease in the number of songs (IRR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.87-1.0]). \autoref[.A]{fig:posteriors} shows the full posterior distribution of the exponentiated parameter estimates reported here, which are from a simpler linear model to make interpretation easier. \autoref[.B-C]{fig:posteriors} shows the marginal effects of the same variables in a GAM model. Note the sharp decrease after the onset of egg laying and towards the end of the breeding season.

# Fieldwork plan for 2021{#fieldwork-plan}

Although this year’s data collection effort has been reasonably successful, an analysis of the factors that influenced sampling success reveals that it can be optimised in the following years.

There is a sharp decrease in singing activity after the end of egg-laying, matching results from @Mace1987. Birds in nests with later lay dates also sing fewer songs, but the main correlate of sampling success is the time passed since the onset of egg-laying. This year (2020) I was not able to collect and reposition more than 10 recorders per day. For a brief period (~4 days), I would have needed to deploy ~30 new recorders per day in order to track the increase in the number of birds that started laying eggs. This delay accumulated and was not dissipated until the end of the recording period.

I will make an effort to reduce this lag in 2021 and 2022. This requires: a) earlier detection of nests with great tit activity, and b) better ability to cope with the influx of new nests. I am discussing different possibilities with my supervisors, including using RFID loggers mounted on nestboxes to monitor early use by great tits, acquiring a larger amount of remote recorders, and recruiting the help of a field assistant during the peak of the fieldwork season.

## Introduction

The introduction will provide a general background to the topic of song learning in birds. I will try to integrate ideas from three bodies of research that are sometimes disconnected: laboratory studies of song ontogeny, behavioural ecology and cultural evolutionary theory. The structure will be an iteration of the [introduction](#general-introduction) above.

## 1. What do great tits sing?{#chapter-1}

The first chapter will provide an in-depth description of the variability present in great tit songs, from a bio-acoustic and information-theoretic perspective. This will include a very detailed case study from the Wytham population and comparison with data from across the distribution range of the species, exploring the following questions:

**Are ‘song types’ meaningful categories at larger spatial scales?** Many birds, including great tits, are thought to learn and produce categorical vocal signals. These are characterised by narrow, clustered feature distributions. As a consequence, discretising individual repertoires is useful to understand the learning and interactions taking place between close neighbours. However, studies typically also classify songs into population-wide discrete categories, often hundreds of them, without clear statistical or theoretical justification. I will **characterise repertoires at different levels of description—from individual notes to transition probabilities between songs**—and use continuous measures of similarity, propagating uncertainty to analyses of the distribution of songs at the population level. Combining continuous measures with categorical song type definitions will then allow me to test the relationship between spatial scale and the robustness of song type categories.

**Which song traits are more constrained, and which more free to vary?** Some regions of the sound space are occupied more densely than others. I will identify these ‘attractors’, describe variability at the different levels of description already mentioned, and determine which song traits have better potential to encode individuality and geographic origin. This will help answer a related question: **Do great tits sing different classes of songs** that are subjected to different cultural evolutionary dynamics?

## 2. Song learning and learning biases{#chapter-2}

The second chapter will constitute the first step in understanding how the diversity described in [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) emerges and evolves. The themes outlined in [song learning biases](#intro-learning-biases) will make up its backbone.

**Are all songs equally likely to be learnt?** Song learning might depend on the frequency with which they are heard, or on how many other males sing them. I will test whether there is evidence for frequency dependence in great tit song learning, or if, on the contrary, learning is unbiased. To do this, I will compare every bird’s songs with those of neighbouring males and measure the relationship between a) the number of males that sing a a song around a focal bird, b) the number of times that the song was recorded, and the probability that the focal male sings it.

**Where are songs more likely to be learnt—and from whom?** I will compare the similarity of a bird’s repertoire to the acoustic landscape of a) its natal grounds and b) its first territory and quantify the relative contribution of each. I will then test whether older males are more likely to serve as tutors than birds in the same generation. 

**Are some learning biases heritable?** There is no evidence that repertoire composition, size or complexity are inheritable in great tits. Work done in the lab with other species suggests that birds might be better at learning songs that are similar in tempo to those of their fathers, and that mean frequency is partially heritable. I will explore if this is the case in known father-song pairs in a wild population after controlling for spatial effects.

**Can learning fidelity explain song similarity at larger spatial scales?** Many studies of bird song have concluded that learning is often extremely accurate, with some even estimating that syllable types can persist for longer than 500 years [e.g., @Lachlan2018b]. Although accurate learning does occur, as laboratory studies show, the fact that innate biases alone can give rise to many species-typical song characteristics, even in isolate, deafened, and self-tutored birds [@Feher2017; @Feher2009; @James2017d; @James2020], suggests that strong convergent transformation during song ontogeny might difficult the estimation of mutation rates. I will explore this by fitting individual-based simulation models of song change to empirical data gathered in the Wytham population over the course of the DPhil, and from other European populations.

## 3. Space and demography

The third chapter will integrate the findings on individual learning biases in [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) with a detailed analysis of the influence of habitat structure, immigration and dispersal ([introduction: space and demography](#intro-spatial-demographic)). Specifically, it will test whether their interaction can account for the pattern of song sharing and variation described in [Chapter 1](#chapter-1), and ask the following questions:

**How well does community structure predict acoustic structure at different scales?** I will use occurrence data from PIT-tagged birds, collected from automated feeding stations equipped with RFID antennae, to construct social and movement networks (see [@Farine2019]). I will then test whether the community structure inferred from them can partially explain the spatial distribution of song similarity.

**Do any song traits change with population density?** I will test whether birds living in higher-density areas, which might provide more opportunities for learning, sing more acoustically typical songs—after controlling for dispersal and number of immigrants, which are known to reduce and increase the diversity within an area, respectively [@Fayet2014; @Rivera-Gutierrez2010a]. Relatedly, I will ask **whether being neighbours with more immigrant birds is correlated with (a) increased acoustic diversity or (b) having larger repertories** at the individual level.

**How is the rate of acoustic change affected by population turnover rates?** The pace of cultural evolution of songs is likely to be influenced by generation times and the rate of turnover. I will test if areas with higher turnover show higher rates of acoustic change over the duration of the project.

## 4. The function of songs

This project will mainly study songs from a cultural evolutionary perspective, in contrast with a majority of studies firmly situated in the field of behavioural ecology. However, as discussed [in the introduction](#why-learn), bird song and song learning are shaped by selective forces and serve biological functions^[As an example of how the nature of what is acceptable as explanation for animal behaviour has changed in the last fifty decades or so, here is a quote from an early paper on song learning by Thorpe: “[t]hat bird song is often an expression of irrepressible joy can be supported with some plausible arguments and is certainly not without some scientific justification” (1958, p. 536).], and these need to be considered. Having a large, multi-generational dataset of songs matched to known individuals will allow us to test questions relating to the current fitness consequences of song-sharing and song performance, and these will constitute the last chapter of the thesis.

**Is song-sharing beneficial? For whom?** Song-sharing might be benefitial for young birds in some species [@Beecher2017a], and perhaps even for both tutor and tutees [@Beecher2020]. I will ask whether this is the case in great tits.

**Is singing common songs beneficial for males?** Singing songs that are common in an area might be beneficial for males if they are important in territorial defence or if females prefer them.

**Are a) consistency in song performance, b) repertoire size, or c) degree of song-sharing with neighbours positively correlated with reproductive success?** If so, is this mediated by territory quality?

**Does song production senesce?** Are any song traits reliable signals of age?

**Is there a trade-off between repertoire size and repertoire complexity?**
