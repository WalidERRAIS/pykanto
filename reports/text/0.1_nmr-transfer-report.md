# Introduction

## General introduction

> *Definitely not a placeholder for a Darwin quote*

### Animal culture and social learning

Culture was once considered the sole domain of humans. Over the past few decades this view has been steadily challenged, and today it is common to find allusions to non-human animal cultures in scientific journals and the popular press alike. To be sure, some energetically oppose the notion, and there is no shortage of disagreement over the very definition of the term ‘culture’. But an increasing number of students of behaviour and evolution suspect that, intricate and distinctive as human culture might be, the difference must be one of degree—not kind.

What constitutes culture, then? For our purposes, we can define it as any behavioural trait that is maintained in a population by virtue of being learnt from others; not genetically inherited, nor independently acquired. [See definitions in @Whiten2017; @Laland2003.] Human ritual funerary practices are cultural, so is the game of croquet. And, under this definition, so are tool use in capuchin monkeys, homing efficiency in pigeons, the songs of many birds, some feeding behaviours in humpback whales, and even mate preferences in fruit flies [@Falotico2019; @Sasaki2017a; @Slater2003; @Allen2013a; @Thornquist2019].

Social learning is ubiquitous among animals, and a prerequisite for culture. Although it may not always be beneficial [@Giraldeau2002; @Whitehead2009; @Henrich1998], there is ample evidence that many of the things that many animals must learn to survive and reproduce can only be acquired by observing or interacting with others [@Galef2005]. Learning will happen more often from animals that are closer in space or in a social group, and this inevitable fact creates opportunities for behaviours to change differently in different populations, sometimes becoming better suited to local conditions. When these differences—beneficial or not—accumulate and persist over time, a cultural tradition is born.

Whether found in humans or other animals, cultures can be transient or long-lasting, disorderly diverse or monolithically uniform. To give two primate examples, chimpanzees (*Pan troglodytes*) may have used stone tools in a similar way for thousands of years [@Mercader2007; @Carvalho2008], and white-faced capuchin monkeys (*Cebus capucinus*) frequently invent and abandon quirky social conventions such as eyeball-poking, handsniffing and tail-sucking [@Perry2003]. 

### Culture in birds

That other animals have a cultural dimension was recognised very early in birds, perhaps before any other group. In -@Barrington1773 Barrington, who conducted some of the earliest experiments in song learning, wrote that “[t]hese differences in the song of birds of the same species cannot perhaps be compared to any thing more apposite, than the varieties of provincial dialects” [p. 280]. In 1920’s South East England, some birds in the tit family started perforating the wax-board or metal foil that sealed milk bottles to guzzle the cream accumulated at the top. In what became a famous case of possible cultural transmission, this behaviour increased in frequency and geographic spread in the following decades [@Fisher1949]. Many years later, @Aplin2015 carried out experiments in a wild population of great tits (*Parus major*) which demonstrated that new foraging behaviours can indeed spread socially and persist.

Another aspect of the lives of some birds that could have an important cultural component is their migration. There is mounting evidence that infomation acquired by individuals and groups when flying along a route can accumulate in populations and, over time and even generations, lead to distinct migratory cultures [@Sasaki2017a; @Berdahl2018]. There are many other examples of social learning and cultural phenomena in birds, see @Aplin2018 for a recent review.

But it is their song, especially that of passerines, that has provided some of the clearest examples of bird cultures. Songs can carry information about the identity and social position of a bird; they are shaped by natural and sexual selection, stochastic processes and directional cultural change, are partly learnt and partly innate, and can crucially be recorded and analysed in minute detail. So it is perhaps not surprising that they should have attracted the attention of researchers from a wide range of fields, from linguistics to evolutionary ecology. The resulting body of literature is vast and cannot be reviewed here: what follows is a short introduction to bird song.

## Bird song: a short introduction

### Historical

Every culture that has ever existed has probably conferred special status to bird song, due to its music-like qualities and the ability of some species to imitate myriad sounds. In his *Historia Animalium* (350 B.C.E), Aristotle wrote that birds were capable of learning their songs, especially ‘broad-tongued’ ones, and that sometimes their voice changed with the ‘diversity of locality’ ([Book 4, Chapter 9](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.4.iv.html)) like those of humans. Aristotle’s is perhaps the earliest recorded attempt at a systematic study of communication, and the first in a long tradition of analogies drawn between bird song and human language [@Kleczkowska2015, @Zirin1980]. 

Many centuries later, in 1650, the German Jesuit Athanasius Kircher used musical notation to transcribe bird songs in an early musicology treatise, *Musurgia Universalis*. [The first known recording](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b00jn4m2) of a singing bird was made in 1889 by Ludwig Koch—the pioneering sound recordist and broadcaster—when he was only eight years old. Then, in the 1940s, the invention of the sound spectrograph at the Bell Telephone Laboratories paved the way for a new generation of studies that were, for the first time, able to measure songs in all manner of detail [@Koenig1946; @Baker2001]. The best example of these is an exhaustive study of the development of the song in the chaffinch, *Fringilla coelebs*, by @Thorpe1958, which was followed by an explosion of interest in the matter—both in the field [@Marler1962; @Marler1964] and the laboratory [see, for example, @Nottebohm1976 on the neurobiology of song production]—which continues unabated to this day.

### Why do some birds learn their songs?

Most birds vocalise, but vocal learning only occurs in three orders (Psittaciformes, Apodiformes, and Passeriformes). Within the passerines, commonly referred to as the perching birds, oscines learn their songs, while suboscines do not. Song learning requires a considerable investment of time and a dedicated brain system, so why might it have evolved and be maintained? 

There are many hypotheses that try to explain the possible benefits of vocal learning. These include a better ability to match the acoustic requirements of different habitats[@Hansen1979; @Rios-Chelen2012], possible benefits gained from sharing songs with neighbours [@Payne2015], and the ability of learned songs to serve as an ‘honest signal’ of developmental stability [@Nowicki2002; Ritchie2008]. Most of the available evidence points to two broad functions; attracting and keeping mates and keeping rivals away [@Collins2004]. However, there is ample variation between species, and the current fitness consequences of song learning, on which these ideas are based, do not necessarily bear on its evolutionary origins. 

Not all birds that learn their songs do so at the same point in their lives or for the same period of time. Some can only learn during the first months after they are born; zebra finch (*Taeniopygia guttata*) juveniles, for example, can only learn and develop their song when they between ~ 20 and 80 days old [@Liu2004]. Other birds can continue to learn and perhaps invent new sounds throughout their lives, like the European starling (*Sturnus vulgaris*). And many birds that disperse early in their lives or even migrate have a ‘sensitive period’ for learning that extends to the time when they stablish their first territory [@Liu2004; @Beecher2005]. Although this range of variation is often summarised into two categories—open- and closed-ended learners—it might be better understood as a spectrum [@Brenowitz2005].

Lastly, there is a fantastic range of variation in repertoire size and complexity. […] repertoire sizes and structure

### (Some of) The forces that shape bird song

In this section I will discuss, in this order, physiological constraints and phylogenetic inertia, ecological factors, and sexual selection. These are crucial in diving large-scale patterns of song evolution, but not the focus of my research. I will then introduce some ideas about cultural transmission dynamics, innate learning biases, and spatial, social and demographic factors. They affect the changes in frequency of socially learnt songs and their properties, that is, their cultural evolution [@Whiten2019]. It is these that I will explore throughout my thesis. All of these processes and their often complex interactions influence bird song and its evolution, but their relative weight is debated. 

#### Physiological constraints and phylogenetic inertia

Birds produce their songs using an organ called the syrinx, which is located at the base of the trachea in an air sac close to the lungs [@Larsen2002]. Its structure and precise location varies between species; those with more complex songs tend to have more syringeal muscles, which allows for precise control of sound [@Suthers2004]. The sounds produced by the syrinx are then filtered and modulated by the trachea and the beak, which together constitute the vocal tract [@Podos2004]. 

The body mass of a species is correlated with the size of its syrinx, which in turn influences the fundamental or lowest resonant frequency of the sounds that it can produce [@Ryan1985; @Martin2011]. This means that vocal evolution will be constrained by any selective pressures impinging on body size, as well as the evolutionary history of the species. The same is true in the case of the beak: there is ample evidence that different beak morphologies influence the pace at which a bird can produce notes and the range of their frequencies [Derryberry2018b; @Derryberry2012; Seddon2005; @Podos2001]. These and other constraints, not least those derived from neural development and energy expenditure, will determine the degrees of freedom afforded to any other factors driving song evolution.

#### Ecological factors

Sound propagates differently in different habitats. For example, vegetation attenuates sound amplitude (‘loudness’), filters some frequencies more than others, and causes reverberation. Different pysical environments have different levels of background noise, with varied acoustic characteristics; there may be sounds of abiotic orign, such as wind, streams and rain, and a cacophony of other species striving to be heard. For songs to be effective they need to be detectable, and this process of acoustic adaptation is thought to be important in driving the evolution of song and other social signals [@Endler1992; @Tobias2010; @Grant2010; but see @Mikula2020 and @Irwin2008a]. 

There are other ecological factors that can lead to song divergence. Body size and beak morphology often change when a population of birds adapts to a different foraging niche, which, as mentioned earlier, can influence some of the acoustic and temporal features of songs as a by-product. [@Dobzhansky1937; @Mayr1963; @Podos2001]. Songs can also change if coexistence between species (sympatry) favours those that can distinguish them more easily, which can help avoid the fitness costs of hybridization or aggresive interactions; this is a mechanism known as character displacement [@Seddon2005]. Interestingly, the opposite—convergent character displacement in sympatry—might also happen if better recognition of competitors is advantageous [@Tobias2009; @Tobias2014; @Grant1972].

#### Sexual selection

Bird song has traditionally been considered a male ornament that evolved through female preference. It is true that in the northern temperate region—where most research has historically taken place—females do not often sing. But recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that, at least in the oscine passerines, dimorphism in the trait is a consequence of multiple losses of elaborate female song rather than gains in males [@Odom2014]. 

Most of the work done in the field of behavioural ecology over the past decades has focused on how females respond to songs and how males use them in territorial interactions. As a result, there is a vast literature detailing how songs can encode multiple messages and serve different, sexually selected functions, with great variation between species and sometimes inconsistent results [see @Catchpole2003 and @Gil2002 for reviews]. To name just a few themes: song frequency can be a reliable indicator of body size [@Ryan1985], temporal and spectral consistency can evidence the nutritional stress suffered in early life [@MacDonald2006], and sharing songs with other males can influence territory acquisition and the outome of agonistic encounters [@Krebs1978; Demko2016a]. Bird song is a higly complex communication signal, so it should be no surprise that it does not have a single, universal function.

#### Genetic drift (and cultural?)

The question of how songs diverge is not so easy to answer, although it has stimulated much research ([14](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/47/20156#ref-14)). Explanations generally invoke random song changes such as those caused by an accumulation of copying errors, morphological changes to the sound-producing apparatus, environmental changes influencing the transmitting properties of song, or acoustical interference with other species ([13](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/47/20156#ref-13), [15](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/47/20156#ref-15), [16](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/47/20156#ref-16)).

Songs may change as a result of stochastic processes such as an accumulation of copying errors between generations in a manner analogous to random genetic drift ([17](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/47/20156#ref-17), [18](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/47/20156#ref-18)), and differences between populations could build up over time. Random change constitutes a null hypothesis for the alternative explanations that invoke systematic factors. [@Grant2010]

#### Learning biases and cultural dynamics

The process of learning introduces a host of new variables that can influence which songs a bird sings, their structure, and how they change over time. First, songs have to be learnt from someone. A bird may learn them from any other bird or, instead, some ‘tutors’ may be preferred: perhaps birds that are older, louder, or sing more often. This is variosly referred to as a tutor, model or demonstrator bias in the cultural evolution literature [ref]. If the cultural transmission of a song happens from parents to offspring it is said to be vertical; horizontal if it happens from other birds in the same generation, and oblique from unrelated individuals in the previos generation [ref]. Sometimes, tutor choice can have extreme consequences: if a female pairs up with a male of a different species because he sings the same song as her father, and her father learnt the ‘wrong’ song, this can lead to the production of hybrid offspring [@Grant1997; Grant1997a].

Some songs might be preferred independently of who sings them—a ‘content bias’ [@Richerson2005]. For example, some song types might be intrinsically harder to sing than others, and male birds could favour learning either easy-to-sing songs or the opposite if singing difficult songs is rewarded. More broadly, there is a very well documented tendency for birds to learn the songs sung by members of their own species [@Slabbekoorn2002], or even subspecies [@Nelson2000]. Preferences can arise through the interaction of innate biases for some regions of the syntactic or phonetic ’trait space’, exposure to sounds during early life and the learning process itself [@Feher2017; @Verzijden2012; @Feher2009]. Importantly, this interaction can be higly complex and show great variation between individuals [see @TenCate2007; @Mets2019; @Mets2017; @James2020].

Birds can also learn a song based on how frequently they have heard it, or how many other birds sing a particular variant [@VanLeeuwen2015; @Aplin2015a]. The relationship between the frequency of a trait in a population and the probability that it is learnt can be linear: if this is the case, transmission is unbiased. However, if more popular traits are more likely to be learnt than it would expeceted given their frequency, learning is said to be conformist, or positively frequency-dependent. And if the opposite is true the pattern is one of anti-conformism, or negative frequency-dependence. Conformist learning seems to be a common strategy in nature, perhaps because it can help individuals to leverage collective information to make decisions about locally adaptive bahaviour [@Pike2010; @Danchin2018; @Whiten2019]. All else being equal, cultural traits will have a slower rate of change if their learning is conformist. Conversely, anti-conformist biases will cause faster turnover [@Acerbi2014], and might arise if individuals have a preference for novelty [but see @Smaldino2015].

Another deteminant of the pace of change of a population’s songs is how accurately birds learn them. Some authors have tried to calculate ‘cultural mutation rates’ for different species to reflect how much songs change from one generation to the next: chaffinches, for example, appear to learn their songs very accurately [@Lachlan2003; @Slater1986], which slows change down. But determining this quantity is complicated by the fact that many other factors also influence the tempo of cultural change. One is the learning strategy used by individuals, already mentioned. Another is the fact that songs can be modified during the learning process in non-random directions, in a process sometimes called convergent transformation or cultural attraction [@Claidiere2018b; @Gray2007a; Morin2016; @Heyes1993]. This can be illustrated by an elegant experiment carried out by @Feher2009: song tutoring lineages were started with birds that were raised in isolation, and each new bird learned from the previous—mimicking natural generations of tutors and pupils. Many of the song features that are typical in the species arose over the course of just a few generations, presumably as a consequence of directional modifications introduced by the learners. 

The available evidence suggests that the changes brought about by cultural dynamics are often neutral or even negative [ref], akin to random genetic drift [@Grant2010].  However, in some cases, cultural change might help birds adapt to novel acoustic landscapes [@Rios-Chelen2012; @Slater2013], or fine-tune the song’s characteristics to better match the shifting perceptual preferences of the receivers [@Renoult2019a]. At larger timescales, the accumulation of either neutral or directional cultural changes in songs might promote reproductive isolation between populations. Nevertheless, and although this possibility has attracted much interest, the evidence for it is lacking [@Verzijden2012; @Yeh2015; @Lachlan2004].

Finally, it is important to note that songs are not necessarily fixed sets of notes or phrases, and different elements might change at different rates and be affected by different cultural, sexual or ecological pressures [see, for example, @Williams2013a and VanBoheemen2019b]. 

#### Spatial, social and demographic factors

The most fundamental determinant of the interactions that lead to vocal learning in a population is the habitat that it occupies. Its physical features, vegetation structure and distribution of resources—which are all tightly linked—bound the use of space made by individuals. This in turn influences their social interactions and emergent social organisation [ see @He2019 for a review] and, ultimately, who learns from who.

Vocal similarity will typically be correlated with spatial proximity if the birds in a population learn their songs with some accuracy and their dispersal is limited. The precise spatial pattern will depend on whether birds disperse before or after they learn, how many songs they learn, and from how many birds [@Williams1990; @Ellers2003], as well as the many sources of learning bias discussed above. When birds remain close to the location where they learned or settle in places where they hear familiar songs, dialects or local song ‘neighbourhoods’ may emerge [@Podos2007]. It then follows that increased dispersal between any two areas within a population will incresase vocal sharing, and that the influx of immigrants from other populations will introduce new variation—a phenomenon that has been attested in wild populations [@Fayet2014]. 

The pace of change of a song culture is influenced by many factors, some of which have already been discussed. The size of a group and its rate of turnover are also important. First, smaller groups are expected to be more influenced by stochastic forces, in a manner analogous to genetic drift [@Kimura1964]. Smaller group sizes can also increase the probability of extinction of a given song variant [@Nunn2009]. Second, higher backgroud mortality and emigration will also lead to faster rates of change, independently of the learning strategy employed by individuals or the fidelity of their learning [@Nunn2009, @Slater1986].

A few theoretical and experimental results suggest that the number, distribution and conectedness of individuals in a population could influence the complexity of cultural traits in addition to its distribution [see, for example, @Derex2018a; @Derex2016a; @Creanza2017, @Fogarty2017; @Kempe2014a]. There are reasons to be sceptical about the prevalence of this process in the case of learned bird songs, however: their complexity is likely to be tightly constrained by developmental factors and sexual selection. However, it remains an interesting possibility. density! 



****

All of these factors are thought to contribute to shaping bird song diversity and how it changes over time and geography. But their relative importance is not well known, and neither is how they interact in wild populations. A long and fruitful history of field studies has provided us with many examples; however, these have tipically been limited by a) small sample sizes, b) a lack of data for individual birds, c) the use of handpicked acoustic features to characterise songs, and d) the aprioristic assumption that population-wide ‘song types’ exist.

Learning biases and the process of cultural transmission have been studied in the laboratory with great precision, and there is a wealth of theoretical models and some field evidence for the influence of some of the spatial, social and demographic factors just outlined.

handpicked acoustic features may miss important dimensions of variability that are important for communicative function. Second, many analyses assume vocalizations fall into discrete vocal categories, often without rigorous justificatio

## Introduction to the study system

### Great tits

Biology of the species and some of the work done with great tit song, especially here in Wytham [e.g., @Hunter1979; @McGregor1982; @Krebs1978; @McGregor1989; @Fayet2014].

> For example, great tits exhibit a conformist bias, where an individual preference to adopt the majority behav- iour leads to the dominance of the most frequent foraging tech- nique (Aplin, Sheldon, & McElreath, 2017; Aplin et al., 2015a, 2015b). N: but this not the case with their songs it seems?

## Concrete aims

- Introduce a possible outline for the thesis — [Thesis plan](#thesis-plan).

# Methods

## Study system

The study was carried out in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK (51°46′N, 1°20′W). Wytham woods is a semi-natural deciduous woodland, around 415 hectares in extension, which is surrounded by farmland. Here, a population of great tits is monitored as part of a long-term survey that began in 1947. The majority of great tits nests in nestboxes with known locations. Every year, fieldworkers record the identities of breeding males and females, the dates of clutch initiation and egg hatching, clutch size, and fledgling success under standardised protocols. A large proportion of birds in the population are fitted with a unique British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) metal leg ring either as nestlings or as adults. During the breeding season, from March to June, great tit pairs are socially monogamous and defend territories around their nestboxes [@Hinde1952].

## Song recording

Every nestbox in the study site is checked by fieldworkers at least once a week before and during egg laying, which can last from one to 14 days [@Perrins1965]. When a nestbox was marked as having great tit activity, which usually coincided with the laying of the first eggs, I placed an autonomous sound recorder in the vicinity of the nestbox—either in the same tree or in a suitable neighbouring tree. I recorded birds in this manner from early April until mid-May, leaving each recorder in the same location for three consecutive days before moving it to a different nestbox. I relocated ten recorders every day throughout the duration of the recording period.

I used 30 AudioMoth recorders  [@Hill2019b], which were housed in waterproof, custom-built enclosures (See Fig X). Recording began approximately one hour before sunrise (~ 05:36 – 04:00 UTC) and consisted of seven 59-minute-long recordings with a sample rate of 48 kHz.

## Definitions

There is not a consistent set of terms used to refer to the different levels at which the acoustic output of a bird can be described. For clarity, these are the definitions that I use throughout this work:

| Term          | Definition                                                   |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Note**      | A single uninterrupted vocalisation; the smallest unit of analysis |
| **Phrase**    | The smallest set of different notes that are repeated stereotypically |
| **Song**      | One or more repeated phrases, preceded and followed by silences of a duration exceeding that of the longest silence between each note in a phrase |
| **Song bout** | A set of one or more songs that are preceded and followed by silences longer than 10 seconds. I will change this to a probabilistic definition based on the distribution of silence durations; typically a more or less arbitrary threshold is used but I’d rather have a better grounded definition |

## Audio analysis

### Pre-processing and segmentation

#### Song segmentation

I inspected spectrograms for each raw recording aided by AviaNZ, an open-source Python program written by Marsland and colleagues [@Marsland2019].  I selected songs based on a simple criterion: that its notes were clearly distinct from background noise and other bird vocalisations. I chose entire songs where it was possible; where it was not, I selected the longest contiguous segment available.

I included songs produced from approximately one hour before sunrise to four hours after sunrise for each bird and day. If a 59-min recording solely contained rain or wind I also included the following 59-min recording.

#### Assigning song bouts to individuals

As a consequence of the automated nature of the recording process, there is a small chance that some of the songs recorded in the immediate vicinity of a given nest box do not belong to the focal bird. To minimise the chance of false positives, I discarded recordings with more than one vocalising bird if one was not distinctly louder than the rest. I also discarded all songs with a maximum amplitude below $-16$ dB, calculated as $20\log_{10}(\frac{A}{A_0})$, with $A= 5000$ and $A_0=32767$ (the maximum value for 16-bit digital audio). This threshold derives from the observation that, in those cases where there are simultaneous recordings of several immediate neighbours, an amplitude cutoff greater than 4000 always separates a focal bird from its nearest neighbours. Note that these are not calibrated values and are, therefore, relative to the recording equipment and settings I used—as well as other factors like sound directionality and vegetation cover.

#### Note segmentation

I segmented the resulting song selections into their constituent notes using a dynamic threshold algorithm implemented by @Sainburg2019b. Briefly, the algorithm finds minima in the spectral envelope of an spectrogram, which are considered silences; if the length of the signal between these minima exceeds a maximum note duration, a new local minimum is defined that divides the signal in two shorter segments. This is repeated until multiple notes are defined or there are no local minima below a maximum amplitude threshold. Then, segments below a minimum note duration threshold are discarded. The minimum and maximum note length thresholds were determined by segmenting a small subset of songs (n = 30) with Chipper, an open-source, Python-based software developed by @Searfoss2020.

**Note**: I am currently working on implementing a segmentation algorithm that deals better with reverberation. Sometimes the previous note overlaps with the next and the current algorithm fails to separate them.

#### Spectrograms

I created spectrograms for each individual note in the dataset (See Fig X) from its normalised and band-passed waveform. I then log-scaled each spectrogram and clipped all values within the fifth lowest percentile, to remove background noise of low amplitude. I then zero-padded each spectrogram with length below the longest note, and built a dataset containing the metadata for each note and its spectrogram.

### Dimensionality reduction and clustering

#### At the population level

I prepared a $N × d$-dimensional array, with $N =$ total number of  notes in the dataset and $d = 64 × 132$, or the length of a flattened two-dimensional spectrogram array. I then projected the first array onto a low-dimensional embedding found using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, [@McInnes2018]) and PHATE  (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding, [@Moon2019]), two non-linear manifold learning and dimensionality reduction algorithms. Full details of the implementation and parameters can be found in the corresponding [code module](#code-availability).

#### For individual birds

In a similar way, I used UMAP to project every note sung by each bird onto a lower-dimensional space. Specifically, I created a two-dimensional projection for visualisation and a ten-dimensional projection for clustering. I then used the latter to infer the note types sung by each bird, by finding areas occupied more densely within the acoustic space using HDBSCAN [@McInnes2017]

**Note:** I am currently defining ‘hard’ clusters, where notes are labelled as either clusters or noise. This makes some clusters a little bit noisy. I might try to implement ‘fuzzy’ clustering, where cluster membership is defined by probability vectors, and deal more strictly with outliers.

### Inferring note transitions

I defined a directed weighted graph $G = (V, E, w)$ describing the repertoire of each bird, where the vertices $V$ are the set of note clusters with $> 10$ members and the directed edges $E$  and weight $w$ correspond to first-order Markov transition probabilities between them.

![An illustration of the process used to infer song types](../figures/2020/ind_repertoires/O66_2020-09-22_17:52:07.png)

### Models of sampling success

I modelled the number of recorded songs in a zero-inflated negative binomial mixed effects model with the lag from the onset of egg laying to the date of recording and the lay date as population-level (‘fixed’) effects. Models fit with the brms package [@Burkner2017a], priors, model comparison, etc.

### Measuring acoustic distance

I am currently extending a method devised by @Mets2018 to measure learning accuracy in the lab to work with unknown tutors and in a larger acoustic space. Once this is ready I will build distance matrices at the note, phrase and song transition levels, and these will be the basis of all subsequent analyses.

### Modelling sampling success

Parameter estimates for models with number of songs recorded as outcome; briefly, 

- More lag from lay date = fewer songs, 
- Later lay date = fewer songs,

- Father subsequently not ID’d = more likely to have 0 songs,

# Data collection plan for 2021

What can be done to make sampling more successful in light of the results above? This will be a brief discussion, the main points as follows:

- There is a sharp decrease in singing activity towards the end of egg laying - much sharper than it seemed to me from the literature, but actually matches results from @Mace1987.

- Birds in nests with later lay dates also sing less, but the main correlate of sampling success is time passed since the onset of egg laying. In 2020 I was not able to place more than 10 recorders per day, but for a brief period (~4 days) I would have needed to place ~35 every day. I didn’t recover from the accumulated lag until almost the end of the recording period.

- Therefore, an effort should be made to reduce this lag.

- This requires:

  a) earlier detection of nests with great tit activity, and

  b) better ability to cope with the influx of nests.
  
- I will discuss potential solutions for a and b.

# Thesis plan

## Introduction

The introduction will provide a general background to the topic of song learning in birds. I will try to integrate ideas from three bodies of research that are sometimes disconnected: laboratory studies of song ontogeny, behavioural ecology and cultural evolutionary theory. The structure will be an iteration of the [introduction](#introduction) above.

## 1. What do great tits sing?

An in-depth description of the variability and similarity of great tit songs, from an acoustic and information-theoretic perspective. This will include a very detailed case study from the Wytham population and comparison with data from across the distribution range of the species.

Questions include:

- Are ‘song types’ meaningful categories at larger spatial scales?
- Which song traits, from the level of notes to sequential organisation, are more constrained, and which more free to vary? Is variation stochastic?

## 2. Song learning and learning biases

An exploration of the landscape of learning in the study population.

Questions include:

- Can the pattern of song sharing be explained in terms of unbiased learning plus the effects of population structure, immigration and dispersal, or does it require further assumptions?

  > However, even in species in which song sharing is highest between neighbours, such as the great tit, Parus major (McGregor & Krebs 1982), there have not been any statistical attempts to link this to song dispersal, where individuals have learned songs, relative to where they sing them.[@Lachlan2003]

- Are all songs equally likely to be learnt? Is there evidence for frequency dependence in great tit song learning?

- Are all males equally likely to serve as tutors?

- There is no evidence that repertoire composition or size are inheritable in great tits. Work done in the lab with other species suggests that birds might be better at learning songs that are similar in tempo to those of their fathers. Is there any evidence for this in a wild population?

- Is there a trade-off between repertoire size and repertoire complexity?

## 3. Space and demography

- How well does community structure predict acoustic structure at different scales?
- Do any song characteristics change with population density?
- How is the rate of acoustic change affected by population turnover rates?
- Does being neighbours with more immigrant birds lead to (a) increased acoustic diversity or (b) having larger repertories?

## 4. Copying fidelity and convergence in bird song

Many studies of bird song have concluded that learning is often extremely accurate, with some even estimating that syllable types can persist for longer than 500 years [e.g., @Lachlan2018b]. Although accurate learning does occur, as laboratory studies show, the fact that innate biases alone can give rise to many species-typical song characteristics, even in isolate, deafened, and self-tutored birds [@Feher2017; @Feher2009; James2017d; @James2020], suggests that strong convergent transformation during song ontogeny might difficult the estimation of mutation rates. I will explore this by fitting individual-based simulation models of song change to empirical data gathered in the Wytham population over three years.

## 5. The function of songs

Having a large dataset of songs matched to known individuals will allow us to test questions relating to the current fitness consequences of song-sharing and song performance.

- Is song-sharing beneficial? For whom? Is singing ’popular’ songs beneficial for males?
- Is spectrotemporal consistency in song performance positively correlated with reproductive success? What about small deviation from small integer ratios in the relationship between note frequencies?
- If there is a relationship between repertoire size or degree of song-sharing with neighbours and RS, is this mediated by territory quality?
- Does song production senesce? Are any song traits reliable signals of age?
