# Introduction

## General introduction

> *Definitely not a placeholder for a Darwin quote*

### Animal culture and social learning

Culture was once considered the sole domain of humans. Over the past few decades this view has been steadily challenged, and today it is common to find allusions to non-human animal cultures in scientific journals and the popular press alike. To be sure, some energetically oppose the notion, and there is no shortage of disagreement over the very definition of the term ‘culture’. But an increasing number of students of behaviour and evolution suspect that, intricate and distinctive as human culture might be, the difference must be one of degree—not kind.

What constitutes culture, then? For our purposes, we can define it as any behavioural trait that is maintained in a population by virtue of being learnt from others; not genetically inherited, nor independently acquired. [See definitions in @Whiten2017; @Laland2003.] Human ritual funerary practices are cultural, so is the game of croquet. And, under this definition, so are tool use in capuchin monkeys, homing efficiency in pigeons, the songs of many birds, some feeding behaviours in humpback whales, and even mate preferences in fruit flies [@Falotico2019; @Sasaki2017a; @Slater2003; @Allen2013a; @Thornquist2019].

Social learning is ubiquitous among animals, and a prerequisite for culture. Although it may not always be beneficial [@Giraldeau2002; @Whitehead2009; @Henrich1998], there is ample evidence that many of the things that many animals must learn to survive and reproduce can only be acquired by observing or interacting with others [@Galef2005]. Learning will happen more often from animals that are closer in space or in a social group, and this inevitable fact creates opportunities for behaviours to change differently in different populations, sometimes becoming better suited to local conditions. When these differences—beneficial or not—accumulate and persist over time, a cultural tradition is born.

Whether found in humans or other animals, cultures can be transient or long-lasting, disorderly diverse or monolithically uniform. To give two primate examples, chimpanzees (*Pan troglodytes*) may have used stone tools in a similar way for thousands of years [@Mercader2007; @Carvalho2008], and white-faced capuchin monkeys (*Cebus capucinus*) frequently invent and abandon quirky social conventions such as eyeball-poking, handsniffing and tail-sucking [@Perry2003]. 

### Culture in birds

That other animals have a cultural dimension was recognised very early in birds, perhaps before any other group. In -@Barrington1773 Barrington, who conducted some of the earliest experiments in song learning, wrote that “[t]hese differences in the song of birds of the same species cannot perhaps be compared to any thing more apposite, than the varieties of provincial dialects” [p. 280]. In 1920’s South East England, some birds in the tit family started perforating the wax-board or metal foil that sealed milk bottles to guzzle the cream accumulated at the top. In what became a famous case of possible cultural transmission, this behaviour increased in frequency and geographic spread in the following decades [@Fisher1949]. Many years later, @Aplin2015 carried out experiments in a wild population of great tits (*Parus major*) that demonstrated that new foraging behaviours can indeed spread socially and persist.

Another aspect of the lives of some birds that could have an important cultural component is their migration. There is mounting evidence that infomation acquired by individuals and groups when flying along a route can accumulate in populations and, over time and even generations, lead to distinct migratory cultures [@Sasaki2017a; @Berdahl2018]. 

But it is their song, especially that of passerines, that has provided some of the clearest examples of bird cultures. Songs can carry information about the identity and social position of a bird; they are shaped by natural and sexual selection, stochastic processes and directional cultural change, are partly learnt and partly innate, and can crucially be recorded and analysed in minute detail. So it is perhaps not surprising that they should have attracted the attention of researchers from a wide range of fields, from linguistics to evolutionary ecology. The resulting body of literature is vast and cannot be reviewed here: what follows is a short introduction to bird song.

## Bird song: a short introduction

### Historical

Tidemann, S., & Gosler, A. (Eds.). (2012). *Ethno-ornithology: Birds, indigenous peoples, culture and society*. Earthscan. https://doi.org/10.4324/9781849774758

Every culture that has ever existed has undoubtedly conferred special status to bird song, due to its music-like qualities and the ability of some species to imitate countless sounds. In his *Historia Animalium* (350 B.C.E), Aristotle wrote that birds were capable of learning their songs, especially ‘broad-tongued’ ones, and that sometimes their voice changed with the ‘diversity of locality’ ([Book 4, Chapter 9](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.4.iv.html)) like those of humans. Aristotle’s is perhaps the earliest recorded attempt at a systematic study of communication, and the first in a long tradition of analogies drawn between bird song and human language [@Kleczkowska2015, @Zirin1980]. 

Many centuries later, in 1650, the German Jesuit Athanasius Kircher used musical notation to transcribe bird songs in an early musicology treatise, *Musurgia Universalis*. [The first known recording](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b00jn4m2) of a singing bird was made in 1889 by Ludwig Koch—the pioneering sound recordist and broadcaster—when he was only eight years old. Then, in the 1940s, the invention of the sound spectrograph at the Bell Telephone Laboratories paved the way for a new generation of studies that were, for the first time, able to measure songs in all manner of detail [@Koenig1946; @Baker2001]. The best example of these is an exhaustive study of the development of the song in the chaffinch, *Fringilla coelebs*, by @Thorpe1958, which was followed by an explosion of interest in the matter—both in the field [@Marler1962; @Marler1964] and the laboratory [see, for example, @Nottebohm1976 on the neurobiology of song production]—which continues unabated to this day.

### Why do some birds learn their songs?

Most birds vocalise, but vocal learning only occurs in three orders (Psittaciformes, Apodiformes, and Passeriformes). Within the passerinescommonly referred to as the perching birds, oscines learn their songs, while suboscines do not. Song learning requires a considerable investment of time and a dedicated brain system, so why might it have evolved and be maintained? 

There are many hypotheses that try to explain the possible benefits of vocal learning. These include a better ability to match the acoustic requirements of different habitats[@Hansen1979; @Rios-Chelen2012], possible benefits gained from sharing songs with neighbours [@Payne2015], and the ability of learned songs to serve as an ‘honest signal’ of developmental stability [@Nowicki2002; Ritchie2008]. Most of the available evidence points to two broad functions; attracting and keeping mates and keeping rivals away [@Collins2004]. However, there is ample variation between species, and the current fitness consequences of song learning, on which these ideas are based, do not necessarily bear on its evolutionary origins. 

### (Some of) The forces that shape bird song

In this section I will discuss, in this order, physiological constraints and phylogenetic inertia, ecological factors, and sexual selection. These are very important but not the focus of my research. I will then introduce some ideas about cultural transmission dynamics, innate biases and spatial, social and demographic factors, which I will explore throughout the thesis. All of these processes influence bird song and how it evolves, but their relative weight is debated. 

#### Physiological constraints and phylogenetic inertia

Birds produce their songs using an organ called the syrinx, which is located at the base of the trachea in an air sac close to the lungs [@Larsen2002]. Its structure and precise location varies between species; those with more complex songs tend to have more syringeal muscles, which allows for precise control of sound [@Suthers2004]. The sounds produced by the syrinx are then filtered and modulated by the trachea and the beak, which constitute the vocal tract [@Podos2004]. 

The body mass of a species is correlated with the size of its syrinx, which in turn determines the fundamental or lowest resonant frequency of the sounds that it can produce [@Ryan1985; @Martin2011]. This means that vocal evolution will be constrained by any selective pressures impinging on body size, as well as the evolutionary history of the species. The same is true in the case of the beak: there is ample evidence that different beak morphologies influences the pace at which a bird can produce notes and the range of their frequencies [Derryberry2018b; @Derryberry2012; Seddon2005; @Podos2001]. These and other constraints, not least those derived from neural development and energy expenditure, will determine the degrees of freedom afforded to any other factor driving song evolution.

#### Ecological factors

1 Sensory drive (==direct== selection imposed by the local signaling environment on the design of acoustic sexual signaling systems [@Seddon2005] ) and so on. 

> Divergence may arise through adaptation to divergent ecologies (Dobzhansky 1951; Mayr 1963), perhaps as a by-product of morphological adaptation (Podos 2001) or else by direct ad- aptation to the signaling environment (Boughman 2002). 
>
> Song is a long-distance communication signal prone to modification by the environ- ment. Different habitats impose varying acoustic effects, such as frequency-dependent reverberations, attenuations, and ir- regular amplitude fluctuations (Marten and Marler 1977; Marten et al. 1977; Wiley and Richards 1982), all of which can interfere with song transmission (Wiley 1991). 
>
> [@Seddon2005]

> direction of song divergence is correlated with the sound transmission properties of habitats, rather than with genetic divergence, ambient noise, or pleiotropic effects of mass and bill size. Our findings indicate that acoustic adaptation adds significantly to stochastic processes underlying song divergence, even [@Tobias2010]

2 Morphological adaptation to different niches - magic traits

3 between species competition, niche partitioning

4 species delimitation, more change in sympatry

> Interactions between species can promote evolutionary divergence of ecological traits and social signals[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12874#ref-CR1),[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12874#ref-CR2), a process widely assumed to generate species differences in adaptive radiation[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12874#ref-CR3),[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12874#ref-CR4),[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12874#ref-CR5). However, an alternative view is that lineages typically interact when relatively old[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12874#ref-CR6), by which time selection for divergence is weak[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12874#ref-CR7),[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12874#ref-CR8) 
>
> Here we use phylogenetic estimates of divergence times to show that increased trait differences among coexisting lineages of ovenbirds (Furnariidae) are explained by their greater evolutionary age in relation to non-interacting lineages, and that—when these temporal biases are accounted for—the only significant effect of coexistence is convergence in a social signal (song). Our results conflict with the conventional view that coexistence promotes trait divergence among co-occurring organisms at macroevolutionary scales, and instead provide evidence that species interactions can drive phenotypic convergence across entire radiations, a pattern generally concealed by biases in age.

#### Sexual selection

Another aspect to which much attention has been paid: how mate choice and competition might select for song complexity and repertoire sharing.



> The evidence for Payne's first version of the hypothesis [that by copying the song of the previous owner of a territory, a young bird taking over that territory may be able to deceive others into re- acting as though the previous owner is still present] comes from his work on indigobirds, Vidua chalybeata (1981a). In this polygynous species there are local dialect groups of up to 20 males sharing song repertoires. Within each group there is one male that obtains most of the matings and when it disappears another bird takes over its call site. Payne proposes that the newcomer is more successful in take-overs if it copies the previous incumbent's songs. Evi- dence for copying is twofold: first, when new birds join a dialect group they adopt the local song pattern; second, when the most successful male adopts a new song type, the others copy it. This does not happen when another mate develops a new song. [@McGregor1984]

#### Cultural transmission dynamics

Model biases, song content and structure biases, and changes that occur as a direct consequence of transmission. General learning strategies, emphasising the role of conformist learning. Discuss the model of overproduction and selective attrition.



- different definitions of conformity (‘copy the majority behaviour’/‘copy the behaviour of the majority’) []

> Other patterns of more deterministic song learn- ing also occur. In a number of Galapagos finch spe- cies (Geospiza), there is a strict father-to-son cul- tural transmission of song pattern details (Grant & Grant, 1989, 1997). Geospiza fortis, G. fuliginosa, G. scandens, and G. magnirostris all follow the fa- ther-to-son inheritance pattern. Over a 20-year pe- riod, cases of hybrid pairings among several of these species apparently were the result of females of one species choosing males of a different species because they sang songs like those of the father of the fe- male mate (Grant & Grant, 1997). - [@Baker2001; also the original refs by the Grants]

#### The interplay of innate biases and social learning

> When the learning involved leads to cultural transmission, an especially interesting case arises, as two separate evolutionary systems contribute to the same phenotype. [@Lachlan2003a]

A brief discussion contrasting a) the emphasis placed by some authors on high-fidelity learning with b) ideas more along the lines of Cecilia Heyes and the french in explaining cultural stability. 

Also briefly introduce the experiments of Tchernichovski, Feher et al in light of ideas about convergent transformation.

And @Mets2019, @Mets2017 and @James2020, etc., on genetically inherited learning tendencies and the role of experience. 



> Under neutral cultural evolution, where no cultural trait has any inherent advantage over another, there is selection in favour of less restrictive genes (genes that allow a wider range of signals to recognized). In contrast, cultural conformity (where the most common cultural trait is favoured) leads to selection in favour of more restrictive genes. [@Lachlan2003a]

#### Spatial, social and demographic factors

How do habitat geometry, social network topology, population size, patterns of dispersal, and turnover influence learning opportunities and contribute to shaping song diversity and evolution? 

> Computer simulation was used to examine whether the distribution of song types in a population of birds, and the changes in those present over time, are likely to be influenced by whether or not individuals have repertoires and by the number of neighbours from which a bird can copy. It is predicted from these simulations that having more neighbours will lead to song types lasting for less time in the population, to greater sharing of song types between birds, to song types being shared by spatially separated groups of birds more often, and to a lower proportion of the repertoire being shared between neighbours. 

> Four traits increased the probability of extinction: smaller group size, higher background mortality, lower transmission rate and more costly traits [@Nunn2009]

#### Polymorphic song cultures

Some bird species maintain highly polymorphic song cultures (this is the case of great tits). Songs are caught between divergent forces (e.g., copying errors) and convergence (due to both learning and convergent transformation, the latter as a consequence of the amplification of innate perceptual/cognitive biases); their interplay bounds the diversity available to other processes. @Tchernichovski2017a propose that, at least some species, ‘cultural’ balancing (negatively frequency-dependent) selection could play an important role. It also seems likely that in some or many cases this could simply be a by-product of the spatial distribution of learners that learn a small number of song types from different tutors.

#### Song structure and syntax

Among the birds that learn their songs, there is a fantastic range of variation in repertoire size and complexity. A brief overview of work done on the diverse syntactic structures of bird songs, small-world organisation, hierarchical and Markovian organisation, etc. 

> This study required zebrafinches to adjust both the pitch and order of syllables. In short, these birds prioritized pitch correctness over syntactical correctness, leaving some syntactical errors in most cases [@Lipkind2017, metioned in @Mizuhara2020] ……Taken together, it is not taken for granted that songbirds perceivesyllables as auditory units. [@Mizuhara2020]

# Methods

## Study system

The study was carried out in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK (51°46′N, 1°20′W). Wytham woods is a semi-natural deciduous woodland, around 415 hectares in extension, which is surrounded by farmland. Here, a population of great tits is monitored as part of a long-term survey that began in 1947. The majority of great tits nests in nestboxes with known locations. Every year, fieldworkers record the identities of breeding males and females, the dates of clutch initiation and egg hatching, clutch size, and fledgling success under standardised protocols. A large proportion of birds in the population are fitted with a unique British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) metal leg ring either as nestlings or as adults. During the breeding season, from March to June, great tit pairs are socially monogamous and defend territories around their nestboxes [@Hinde1952].

## Song recording

Every nestbox in the study site is checked by fieldworkers at least once a week before and during egg laying, which can last from one to 14 days [@Perrins1965]. When a nestbox was marked as having great tit activity, which usually coincided with the laying of the first eggs, I placed an autonomous sound recorder in the vicinity of the nestbox—either in the same tree or in a suitable neighbouring tree. I recorded birds in this manner from early April until mid-May, leaving each recorder in the same location for three consecutive days before moving it to a different nestbox. I relocated ten recorders every day throughout the duration of the recording period.

I used 30 AudioMoth recorders  [@Hill2019b], which were housed in waterproof, custom-built enclosures (See Fig X). Recording began approximately one hour before sunrise (~ 05:36 – 04:00 UTC) and consisted of seven 59-minute-long recordings with a sample rate of 48 kHz.

## Definitions

There is not a consistent set of terms used to refer to the different levels at which the acoustic output of a bird can be described. For clarity, these are the definitions that I use throughout this work:

| Term          | Definition                                                   |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Note**      | A single uninterrupted vocalisation; the smallest unit of analysis |
| **Phrase**    | The smallest set of different notes that are repeated stereotypically |
| **Song**      | One or more repeated phrases, preceded and followed by silences of a duration exceeding that of the longest silence between each note in a phrase |
| **Song bout** | A set of one or more songs that are preceded and followed by silences longer than 10 seconds. I will change this to a probabilistic definition based on the distribution of silence durations; typically a more or less arbitrary threshold is used but I’d rather have a better grounded definition |

## Audio analysis

### Pre-processing and segmentation

#### Song segmentation

I inspected spectrograms for each raw recording aided by AviaNZ, an open-source Python program written by Marsland and colleagues [@Marsland2019].  I selected songs based on a simple criterion: that its notes were clearly distinct from background noise and other bird vocalisations. I chose entire songs where it was possible; where it was not, I selected the longest contiguous segment available.

I included songs produced from approximately one hour before sunrise to four hours after sunrise for each bird and day. If a 59-min recording solely contained rain or wind I also included the following 59-min recording.

#### Assigning song bouts to individuals

As a consequence of the automated nature of the recording process, there is a small chance that some of the songs recorded in the immediate vicinity of a given nest box do not belong to the focal bird. To minimise the chance of false positives, I discarded recordings with more than one vocalising bird if one was not distinctly louder than the rest. I also discarded all songs with a maximum amplitude below $-16$ dB, calculated as $20\log_{10}(\frac{A}{A_0})$, with $A= 5000$ and $A_0=32767$ (the maximum value for 16-bit digital audio). This threshold derives from the observation that, in those cases where there are simultaneous recordings of several immediate neighbours, an amplitude cutoff greater than 4000 always separates a focal bird from its nearest neighbours. Note that these are not calibrated values and are, therefore, relative to the recording equipment and settings I used—as well as other factors like sound directionality and vegetation cover.

#### Note segmentation

I segmented the resulting song selections into their constituent notes using a dynamic threshold algorithm implemented by @Sainburg2019b. Briefly, the algorithm finds minima in the spectral envelope of an spectrogram, which are considered silences; if the length of the signal between these minima exceeds a maximum note duration, a new local minimum is defined that divides the signal in two shorter segments. This is repeated until multiple notes are defined or there are no local minima below a maximum amplitude threshold. Then, segments below a minimum note duration threshold are discarded. The minimum and maximum note length thresholds were determined by segmenting a small subset of songs (n = 30) with Chipper, an open-source, Python-based software developed by @Searfoss2020.

**Note**: I am currently working on implementing a segmentation algorithm that deals better with reverberation. Sometimes the previous note overlaps with the next and the current algorithm fails to separate them.

#### Spectrograms

I created spectrograms for each individual note in the dataset (See Fig X) from its normalised and band-passed waveform. I then log-scaled each spectrogram and clipped all values within the fifth lowest percentile, to remove background noise of low amplitude. I then zero-padded each spectrogram with length below the longest note, and built a dataset containing the metadata for each note and its spectrogram.

### Dimensionality reduction and clustering

#### At the population level

I prepared a $N × d$-dimensional array, with $N =$ total number of  notes in the dataset and $d = 64 × 132$,  the length of a flattened two-dimensional spectrogram array. I then projected the first array onto a low-dimensional embedding found using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, [@McInnes2018] ) and PHATE  (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding, [@Moon2019]), two non-linear manifold learning and dimensionality reduction algorithms. Full details of the implementation and parameters can be found in the corresponding [code module](#code-availability).

#### For individual birds

In a similar way, I used UMAP to project every note sung by each bird onto a lower-dimensional space. Specifically, I created a two-dimensional projection for visualisation and a ten-dimensional projection for clustering. I then used the latter to infer the note types sung by each bird, by finding areas occupied more densely within the acoustic space using HDBSCAN [@McInnes2017]

**Note:** I am currently defining ‘hard’ clusters, where notes are labelled as either clusters or noise. This makes some clusters a little bit noisy. I might try to implement ‘fuzzy’ clustering, where cluster membership is defined by probability vectors, and deal more strictly with outliers.

### Inferring note transitions

I defined a directed weighted graph $G = (V, E, w)$ describing the repertoire of each bird, where the vertices $V$ are the set of note clusters with $> 10$ members and the directed edges $E$  and weight $w$ correspond to first-order Markov transition probabilities between them, after removing connections with probability below $0.07$. 

![An illustration of the process used to infer song types](../figures/2020/ind_repertoires/O66_2020-09-22_17:52:07.png)

### Models of sampling success

I modelled the number of recorded songs in a zero-inflated negative binomial mixed effects model with the lag from the onset of egg laying to the date of recording and the lay date as population-level (‘fixed’) effects. Models fit with the brms package [@Burkner2017a], priors, model comparison, etc.

### Measuring acoustic distance

I am currently extending a method devised by @Mets2018 to measure learning accuracy in the lab to work with unknown tutors and in a larger acoustic space. Once this is ready I will build distance matrices at the note, phrase and song transition levels, and these will be the basis of all subsequent analyses.

# Data collection plan for 2021

What can be done to make sampling more successful in light of the results above? This will be a brief discussion, the main points as follows:

- There is a sharp decrease in singing activity towards the end of egg laying - much sharper than it seemed to me from the literature, but actually matches results from @Mace1987.

- Birds in nests with later lay dates also sing less, but the main correlate of sampling success is time passed since the onset of egg laying. In 2020 I was not able to place more than 10 recorders per day, but for a brief period (~4 days) I would have needed to place ~35 every day. I didn’t recover from the accumulated lag until almost the end of the recording period.

- Therefore, an effort should be made to reduce this lag.

- This requires:

  a) earlier detection of nests with great tit activity, and

  b) better ability to cope with the influx of nests.
  
- I will discuss potential solutions for a and b.

# Thesis plan

## Introduction

The introduction will provide a general background to the topic of song learning in birds. I will try to integrate ideas from three bodies of research that are sometimes disconnected: laboratory studies of song ontogeny, behavioural ecology and cultural evolutionary theory. The structure will be an iteration of the [introduction](#introduction) above.

## 1. What do great tits sing?

An in-depth description of the variability and similarity of great tit songs, from an acoustic and information-theoretic perspective. This will include a very detailed case study from the Wytham population and comparison with data from across the distribution range of the species.

Questions include:

- Are ‘song types’ meaningful categories at larger spatial scales?
- Which song traits, from the level of notes to sequential organisation, are more constrained, and which more free to vary? Is variation stochastic?

## 2. Song learning and learning biases

An exploration of the landscape of learning in the study population.

Questions include:

- Can the pattern of song sharing be explained in terms of unbiased learning plus the effects of population structure, immigration and dispersal, or does it require further assumptions?

- Are all songs equally likely to be learnt? Is there evidence for frequency dependence in great tit song learning?

- Are all males equally likely to serve as tutors?

- There is no evidence that repertoire composition or size are inheritable in great tits. Work done in the lab with other species suggests that birds might be better at learning songs that are similar in tempo to those of their fathers. Is there any evidence for this in a wild population?
- Is there a trade-off between repertoire size and repertoire complexity?

## 3. Space and demography

- How well does community structure predict acoustic structure at different scales?
- Do any song characteristics change with population density?
- How is the rate of acoustic change affected by population turnover rates?
- Does being neighbours with more immigrant birds lead to (a) increased acoustic diversity or (b) having larger repertories?

## 4. Copying fidelity and convergence in bird song

Many studies of bird song have concluded that learning is often extremely accurate, with some even estimating that syllable types can persist for longer than 500 years [e.g., @Lachlan2018b]. Although accurate learning does occur, as laboratory studies show, the fact that innate biases alone can give rise to many species-typical song characteristics, even in isolate, deafened, and self-tutored birds [@Feher2017; @Feher2009; James2017d; @James2020], suggests that strong convergent transformation during song ontogeny might difficult the estimation of mutation rates. I will explore this by fitting individual-based simulation models of song change to empirical data gathered in the Wytham population over three years.

## 5. The function of songs

Having a large dataset of songs matched to known individuals will allow us to test questions relating to the current fitness consequences of song-sharing and song performance.

- Is song-sharing beneficial? For whom? Is singing ’popular’ songs beneficial for males?
- Is spectrotemporal consistency in song performance positively correlated with reproductive success? What about small deviation from small integer ratios in the relationship between note frequencies?
- If there is a relationship between repertoire size or degree of song-sharing with neighbours and RS, is this mediated by territory quality?
- Does song production senesce? Are any song traits reliable signals of age?
