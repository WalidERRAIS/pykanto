### Animal culture and social learning

Culture was once considered the sole domain of humans. Over the past few decades this view has been steadily challenged, and today it is common to find allusions to non-human animal cultures in scientific journals and the popular press alike. To be sure, some energically oppose the notion, and there is no shortage of disagreement over the very definition of the term ‘culture’. But an increasing number of students of  behaviour and evolution suspect that, intricate and distinctive as human culture might be, the difference must be one of degree—not kind.

What constitutes culture, then? For our purposes, we can define it as any behavioural trait that is maintained in a population by virtue of being learnt from others; not genetically inherited, nor individually acquired. [see definitions in @Whiten2017; @Laland2003 .] Human ritual funerary practices are cultural, so is the sport criquet. And, under this definition, so are tool use in capuchin monkeys, homing efficiency in pigeons, the songs of many birds, some feeding behaviours in humpback whales, and even mate prefrences in frut flies [Falotico2019; Sasaki2017a; Slater2003; Allen2013a; @Thornquist2019].

Social learning is ubiquitous among animals, and a prerequisite for culture. Although it may not always be benefitial [@ref], there is ample evidence that many of the things that many animals must learn to survive and reproduce can only be acquired by observing or interacting with others [@Galef2005]. Learning will happen more often from animals that are closer in space or in a social group, and this inevitable fact creates opportunities for behaviours to change differently in different populations, sometimes becoming better suited to local conditions. When these differences—benefitial or not—accumulate and persist over time, a cultural tradition is born.

Wether found in humans or other animals, cultures can be transient or long-lasting, disorderly diverse or monolithically uniform. To give two primate examples, chimpanzees (*Pan troglodytes*) may have used stone tools in a similar way for thousands of years [@Mercader2007; @Carvalho2008], and white-faced capuchin monkeys (*Cebus capucinus*) frequently invent and abandon quirky social conventions such as eyeball-poking, handsniffing and tail-sucking [@Perry2003].

### Cultural evolution in birds

[For a recent review see @Aplin2018]



Socially learned acoustic signals, such as the song of humpback whales and oscine songbirds, offer incredibly valuable opportunities for answering some of these questions. Songs can convey information about the identity and social position of signallers; they are moulded by natural and sexual selection, stochastic change and cultural processes, and, crucially, can be recorded and analysed in minute detail. 

Building on a rich tradition of research into passerine song, recent methodological and theoretical advances 21,31,32 have made it possible to study innate structural biases 10,33 and conformist biases 24 in song learning, spatial variation in repertoire sharing and novelty, timing of song acquisition in the wild 36 , relationships between singing rate, personality and territoriality, and song structure and syntax .

Across bird taxa, the importance of social learning for song production is sparse, and the size of the repertoire thus acquired varies greatly . Among the obligate social learners, species whose songs are not exclusively transmitted from father to offspring provide an excellent opportunity to gain a more nuanced understanding of the many factors shaping the evolution of cultural traits.

… why song is great to study this: here comes a brief intro to song.

## Introduction to bird song

#### Historical

Intro to the study of bird song, historical and current. 

#### Why sing?

##### Functions:

Great tit males react more aggresively towards non-neighbour songs, and this depends on the breeding stage (dear enemy effect lost in nestling stage) [@Jin2020]

Link between song complexity and RS not very clear [@Soma2011], and measures of complexity not correlated [@??]

#### Song learning in pylogenetic perspective

#### Stability

> The temporal stabi lity of dialect bounda ries was described explicitl y by many authors . Some taxa retain similar bounda ries and acoustic charac terist ics of son g types over long pe riods of time ( Hansen , 1999; Thielcke, 1987) while others change rapidly, even within a season (Trainer, 1989). We classified dialect stability as short‐term, moderate‐ term, and long‐term, coded as 1, 2, or 3, respectively. Short‐term dialects maintained 2–6 years of stability. In the case of most passerine species, this probably corresponds to the life span of individuals of the species (Weat herhead and Forbes, 1994). Mod erate ‐ term dialect s were defined as being stable for 6–20 years, and long‐term dialects as being stable for greater than 20 years. [@Podos2007a]

> Dialects in predispersal learners thus occur in species with smaller repertoires, and when they occur, they tend to be relatively stable in time. By contrast, dialects in postdispersal learners tend to cover smaller regions and be less stable over time, though there is considerable variation among dialects exhibited by postdispersal learners.[@Podos2007a]

#### Cultural dynamics and (co-evol) consequences



## What determines which songs are sung-and their properties?

#### Song acquisition: mode of transmission, who learns from who. 



#### Which songs in particular? learned content biases and innate constraints

[@Haynes1993]

>  That universal acoustic patterns are observed in the songs of both untutored and early-deafened birds highlights the contribution motor production biases to the emergence of universals in culturally transmitted behaviors. [@James2020]

> The findings thus suggest that tailoring instruction to suit an individual's natural learning tendencies – which depend on their genes – can enhance learning. [@Mets2019a]

#### Spatial and demographic factors affect song (learning opportunities) in birds



#### Song design and natural variation of song;  constraints and polymorphic cultures



## Introduction to the study system

#### Great tit

Great Tits, Parus major L., are one such species. Their repertoire consists of 1 to 8 phrases, or song types, that they learn from conspecifics—primarily during their first year of life, until they have established a territory. Male great tits are more likely to share song types with neighbouring breeding males than with their fathers, and similarity in their songs and repertoire novelty and size are known to be influenced by spatial and demographic factors . 

However, despite a wealth of studies on great tit song, the mechanisms that govern its learning and variation remain unclear. Furthermore, characterisation of their features has been generally limited to a few acoustic and temporal parameters that may not be of great biological relevance .

# Methods

## Study system



The study was carried out in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK (51°46′N, 1°20′W). Wytham woods is a semi-natural deciduous woodland, around 415 hectares in extension, which is surrounded by farmland. Here, a population of great tits has been monitored as part of a long-term survey beggining in 1947. The majority of great tits nests in nestboxes with know locations. Every year, fieldworkers record the identities of breeding males and females, the dates of clutch initiation and egg hatching, clutch size, and fledgling success under standardized protocols. A large proportion of birds in the population are fitted with a unique British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) metal leg ring either as nestlings or as adults. During the breeding season, from March to June, great tit pairs are socially monogamous and defend territories around their nestboxes [@Hinde1952].

## Song recording

Every nestbox in the study site is checked by fieldworkers at least once a week before and during egg laying, which can last from one to 14 days [@Perrins1965]. When a nestbox was marked as having great tit activity, which usually coincided with the laying of the first eggs, I placed an autonomous sound recorder in the vicinity of the nestbox—either in the same tree or in a suitable neigbouring tree. I recorded birds in this manner from early April until mid-May, leaving each recorder in the same location for three consecutive days before moving it to a different nestbox. I relocated 10 recorders every day throughout the duration of the recording period.

I used 30 AudioMoth recorders  [@Hill2019b], which were housed in waterproof, custom-built enclosures (See Fig X). Recording began approximately one hour before sunrise (~ 05:36 – 04:00 UTC) and consisted of seven 59-minute-long recordings with a sample rate of 48 kHz.

## Audio analysis

### Segmentation
#### Songs

I inspected spectrograms for each raw recording aided by AviaNZ, an open-source Python program written by Marsland and colleagues [@Marsland2019].  I selected songs based on a simple criterion: that the syllables were clearly distinct from background noise and other bird vocalisations. I chose entire songs where it was possible; where it was not, I selected the longest contiguous segment available.

I included songs produced from approximately one hour before sunrise to four hours after sunrise for each bird and day. If a 59-min recording solely contained rain or wind I checked an extra hour per bird, to maximise the chances of detection.

#### Assigning song bouts to individuals

As a consequence of the automated nature of the recording process, there is a small chance that some of the songs recorded in the immediate vicinity of a given nest box do not belong to the focal bird. To minimise the chance of false positives, I discarded recordings with more than one vocalising bird if one was not distinctly louder than the rest. I also discarded all songs with a maximum amplitude below $-16$ dB, calculated as $20\log_{10}(\frac{A}{A_0})$, with $A= 5000$ and $A_0=32767$ (the maximum value for 16-bit digital audio). This threshold derives from the observation that, in those cases where there are simultaneous recordings of several immediate neighbours, an amplitude cutoff greater than 4000 always separates a focal bird from its nearest neighbours. Note that these are not calibrated values and are, therefore, relative to the recording equipment and settings I used—as well as other factors like sound directionality and vegetation cover.

#### Notes



> To segment song bouts into syllables, we computed the spectral envelope of each song spectrogram, as the sum power across the Mel-scaled frequency channels at every time-sample in the spectrogram. We defined syllables operationally as periods of continuous vocalisation bracketed by silence. To find syllables, we first marked silences by minima in the spectral envelope and considered the signal between each silence as a putative syllable. We then compared the duration of the putative syllable with an upper bound on the expected syllable length for each species. If the putative syllable was longer than the expected syllable length, it was assumed to be a concatenation of two or more syllables which had not yet been segmented, and the threshold for silence was raised to find the boundary between those syllables. This processes repeated iteratively for each putative syllable until it was either segmented into multiple syllables or a maximum threshold was reached, at which point it was accepted as a long syllable. This dynamic segmentation algorithm is important for capturing certain introductory whistles in the European starling song, which can be several times longer than any other syllable in a bout.

I segmented the resulting song selections into their constituent notes—defined as a single uninterrupted vocalisation—using a dynamic threshold algorithm implemented by Sainburg et al [-@Sainburg2019b]. Briefly, the algorithm finds minima in the spectral envelope of an spectrogram, which are considered silences; if the length of the signal between these minima exceeds a maximum note duration, a new local minima is defined that divides the signal in two shorter segments. This is repeated until multiple notes are defined or there are no local minima below a maximum amplitude threshold. Then, segments below a minimum note duration threshold are

### Dimensionality reduction and clustering

I created spectrograms for each individual syllable in the dataset (See Fig X), normalised them and clipped values in the 5th lowest percentile. I then projected the spectrograms on a low-dimensional space using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, [@McInnes2018] ) and PHATE  [@Moon2019] ,  a non-linear dimension reduction algorithm that preserves global structure
