### Cultural evolution and social learning

Culture was once considered the sole domain of humans. Over the past few decades this view has been steadily challenged, and today it is common to find allusions to non-human animal cultures in scientific journals and the popular press alike. To be sure, some energically oppose the notion, and there is no shortage of disagreement over the very definition of the term ‘culture’. But an increasing number of students of  behaviour and evolution suspect that, intricate and distinctive as human culture might be, the difference must be one of degree—not kind.

What constitutes culture, then? For our purposes, we can define it in broad terms as any behaviour that is maintained in a population by virtue of being learnt from others.

Culture is information transmitted between individuals or groups, where this information flows through and brings about the reproduction of, and a lasting change in, the behavioral trait.

[@Whiten2017]

Once considered the sole domain of humans, culturally influenced behaviours are now recognised in a rapidly increasing number of other species. From tool use in capuchin monkeys and homing efficiency in pigeons to song repertoires and feeding behaviour in humpback whales, socially transmitted information plays a role in shaping the evolutionary trajectories of many, phylogenetically distant species; affecting individual fitness and contributing to local adaptation, population structuring and, perhaps, speciation processes.

Precisely because cultural traits are learnt from other individuals, they are subject to spatiotemporal variation and differential perdurance over time. They are also influenced by factors such as geographical and genetic distance , immigration and dispersal patterns, learning biases, copying fidelity, population size and connectedness, and social network topology. This underscores the importance of integrating individual-level patterns of learning, movement and interaction with higher-level descriptions—of, e.g., the topology of information-transmission networks—for understanding how cultures can emerge, remain stable and differentiate. 

In this vein, recent studies have found that social networks predict the spread of foraging strategies in humpback whales and great tits, which might occur primarily via positive frequency-dependent, or conformist, social learning. Conformist biases, which can lead to very stable traditions, are thought to play a crucial role in human culture; there is now mounting evidence that other animals also employ this learning strategy. Others have investigated how demographic or ecological factors influence the distribution of socially acquired traits; however, we still know relatively little about how these and other mechanisms interact and give rise to cultural differentiation.

### Cultural evolution in birds

Socially learned acoustic signals, such as the song of humpback whales and oscine songbirds, offer incredibly valuable opportunities for answering some of these questions. Songs can convey information about the identity and social position of signallers; they are moulded by natural and sexual selection, stochastic change and cultural processes, and, crucially, can be recorded and analysed in minute detail. 

Building on a rich tradition of research into passerine song, recent methodological and theoretical advances 21,31,32 have made it possible to study innate structural biases 10,33 and conformist biases 24 in song learning, spatial variation in repertoire sharing and novelty, timing of song acquisition in the wild 36 , relationships between singing rate, personality and territoriality, and song structure and syntax .

Across bird taxa, the importance of social learning for song production is sparse, and the size of the repertoire thus acquired varies greatly . Among the obligate social learners, species whose songs are not exclusively transmitted from father to offspring provide an excellent opportunity to gain a more nuanced understanding of the many factors shaping the evolution of cultural traits.

… why song is great to study this: here comes a brief intro to song.

## Introduction to bird song

#### Historical

Intro to the study of bird song, historical and current. 

#### Why sing?

##### Functions:

Great tit males react more aggresively towards non-neighbour songs, and this depends on the breeding stage (dear enemy effect lost in nestling stage) [@Jin2020]

Link between song complexity and RS not very clear [@Soma2011], and measures of complexity not correlated [@??]

#### Different strategies or whatever



#### Song learners types, cultural/social transmission of song



#### Cultural dynamics and (co-evol) consequences



## What determines which songs are sung-and their properties?

#### Song acquisition: mode of transmission, who learns from who. 



#### Which songs in particular? learned content biases and innate constraints

##### Learning mechanisms, freq. dep. learning



>  That universal acoustic patterns are observed in the songs of both untutored and early-deafened birds highlights the contribution motor production biases to the emergence of universals in culturally transmitted behaviors. [@James2020]

> The findings thus suggest that tailoring instruction to suit an individual's natural learning tendencies – which depend on their genes – can enhance learning. [@Mets2019a]

#### Spatial and demographic factors affect song (learning opportunities) in birds



#### Song design and natural variation of song;  constraints and polymorphic cultures



## Introduction to the study system

#### Great tit

Great Tits, Parus major L., are one such species. Their repertoire consists of 1 to 8 phrases, or song types, that they learn from conspecifics—primarily during their first year of life, until they have established a territory. Male great tits are more likely to share song types with neighbouring breeding males than with their fathers, and similarity in their songs and repertoire novelty and size are known to be influenced by spatial and demographic factors . 

However, despite a wealth of studies on great tit song, the mechanisms that govern its learning and variation remain unclear. Furthermore, characterisation of their features has been generally limited to a few acoustic and temporal parameters that may not be of great biological relevance .

## Audio analysis

### Segmentation
#### Songs

I inspected spectrograms for each raw recording aided by AviaNZ, an open-source Python program written by Marsland and colleagues [@Marsland2019].  I selected songs based on a simple criterion: that the syllables were clearly distinct from background noise and other bird vocalisations. I chose entire songs where it was possible; where it was not, I selected the longest contiguous segment available.

I included songs produced from approximately one hour before sunrise to four hours after sunrise for each bird and day. If a 59-min recording solely contained rain or wind I checked an extra hour per bird, to maximise the chances of detection.

#### Assigning song bouts to individuals

As a consequence of the automated nature of the recording process, there is a small chance that some of the songs recorded in the vicinity of a given nest box do not belong to the focal bird. To minimise the chance of false positives, I discarded recordings with more than one vocalising bird if one was not distinctly louder than the rest. I also discarded all songs with a maximum amplitude below $-16$ dB, calculated as $20\log_{10}(\frac{A}{A_0})$, with $A= 5000$ and $A_0=32767$ (the maximum value for 16-bit digital audio). This threshold derives from the observation that, in those cases where there are simultaneous recordings of several immediate neighbours, an amplitude cutoff greater than 4000 always separates a focal bird from its nearest neighbours. Note that these are not calibrated values and are, therefore, relative to the recording equipment and settings I used—as well as other factors like sound directionality and vegetation cover.

#### Syllables



> To segment song bouts into syllables, we computed the spectral envelope of each song spectrogram, as the sum power across the Mel-scaled frequency channels at every time-sample in the spectrogram. We defined syllables operationally as periods of continuous vocalisation bracketed by silence. To find syllables, we first marked silences by minima in the spectral envelope and considered the signal between each silence as a putative syllable. We then compared the duration of the putative syllable with an upper bound on the expected syllable length for each species. If the putative syllable was longer than the expected syllable length, it was assumed to be a concatenation of two or more syllables which had not yet been segmented, and the threshold for silence was raised to find the boundary between those syllables. This processes repeated iteratively for each putative syllable until it was either segmented into multiple syllables or a maximum threshold was reached, at which point it was accepted as a long syllable. This dynamic segmentation algorithm is important for capturing certain introductory whistles in the European starling song, which can be several times longer than any other syllable in a bout.

I segmented the resulting song selections into their constituent syllables—defined as a single uninterrupted vocalisation—using a dynamic threshold algorithm implemented  by Sainburg et al [@??]. Briefly, the algorithm iteratively …

### Dimensionality reduction and clustering

I created spectrograms for each individual syllable in the dataset (See fig X), normalised them and clipped values in the 5th lowest percentile. I then projected the spectrograms on a low-dimensional space using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, [@McInnes2018] ) and PHATE  [@Moon2019] ,  a non-linear dimension reduction algorithm that preserves global structure
