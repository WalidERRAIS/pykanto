### Abstract for Poster (Culture Conference)


Great Tits, Parus major L., are one such species. Their repertoire consists of 1 to 8
phrases, or song types, that they learn from conspecifics—primarily during their
first year of life, until they have established a territory43–46. Male great tits are more
likely to share song types with neighbouring breeding males than with their
fathers44, and similarity in their songs and repertoire novelty and size are known
to be influenced by spatial and demographic factors8. However, despite a wealth
of studies on great tit song, the mechanisms that govern its learning and variation
remain unclear. Furthermore, characterization of their features has been generally
limited to a few acoustic and temporal parameters that may not be of great
biological relevancy.

Across bird taxa, the importance of social learning for song production is sparse, and the size of the repertoire
thus acquired varies greatly42. Among the obligate social learners, species whose songs are not exclusively
transmitted from father to offspring provide an excellent opportunity to gain a more nuanced understanding of
the many factors shaping the evolution of cultural traits.

i. How do songs within a population vary in the acoustic feature space? Can stochastic changes be discerned
from directional ones? Are any phrases or acoustic features more likely to co-occur in songs?
ii. Do social association networks carry over to pathways of song learning, and/or vice versa? Is the topology
of the song-sharing network different for different phrases or acoustic features, perhaps suggesting
different functions? Are songs learned from kin and non-kin different in any way?
iii. Are some individuals (model bias), song characteristics or phrase types (content bias) preferentially
copied, and is learning generally conformist positively frequency-dependent (conformist bias)?
iv. How do migration events between different parts of the population and other demographic factors exert
influence on the cultural stability and differentiation of songs?


The great tit (*Parus major*) is a small and widespread bird that has become a model species for research in social learning and cognition. Year after year, the males in each new generation of great tits learns songs from other males, songs that they will use to entice females and defend their territories.
 from other their songs from other ETheir songs exhibit great variability but are at the same time highly constrained by their function and species
