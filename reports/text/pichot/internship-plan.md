# Plan for Loanne Pichot



While she quarantines I will introduce her to the basics of the project, to some of the programs I’ve written to process the data, and will begin to discuss her own research project.

Ready to work: 18 February

1. Assemble audiomoth cases, install firmware and test all units.
2. Become familiar with the storage and backup system
3. Familiarise  with the layout of the woods

Earliest laying date: 25 march

## Faceplating:

Define a path between nestboxes (n = to be determined based on experience), walk back to origin and collect. 

Q: How long to keep each plate? 1h?

Dump data at the end of the day and prepare plan to deploy recorders the following day.

We can exchange roles - one day faceplating, the next with recorders. Both every day.

## Recording:

Depending on success with faceplates, we can either continue to do this while also using information from fieldworkers or switch to fieldworker information completely when egg laying starts.

I will divide the nests that need to be recorded in two groups and assign one to Loanne. 

Not a lot of data collected after 9pm so will stop recording earlier than last year to give us more time to remove, prepare and redeploy recorders.

## Data management

Every day after collecting the recorders we will pause to dump the data, prepare the recorders to be redeployed, and have lunch. Loanne will help copying and backing up data, and with battery charging and planning.



Chances are that we won’t have time for anything else during this time - last year I was having 12h days most days. Once things become quieter I will introduce her in more depth to the process of song segmentation and analysis.
