# Interactive app

`pykanto` includes a web application that allows you to interactively explore your data. It can be launched using a method of `KantoData` objects, for example:

```python
dataset.open_label_app()
```

This will open a new tab in your browser: you can follow the instructions in the app to explore and label your data.

Running the web application requires having run the following methods on your `KantoData` object:

```python
dataset.segment_into_units()
dataset.get_units()
dataset.cluster_ids()
dataset.prepare_interactive_data()
```

In short, these find distinct units in each vocalisation, label them, and create lightweight representations of the sounds, see the entire process in the [basic workflow page](./basic-workflow.ipynb) for more details.
