# Training ML models

`pykanto` can be used to filter and prepare data to train classifiers.
There is a complete example in the [preprint presenting `pykanto`](LINK) that
walks you through the steps of training a 'deep learning' model to distinguish
between different birds based on their songs. The code to run this example,
whoch you can adapt to your own data, is available in its onwn repository: [LINK](LINK).
