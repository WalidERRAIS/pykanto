`pykanto` can be used to filter and prepare data to train any model.
There is a complete example in the [article presenting `pykanto`](LINK) that
walks you through the steps of training a 'deep learning' model to differentiate
between different birds based on their songs. The code to run this example,
which you can easily use with your own data, is available in its onwn
repository: [LINK](LINK).
